﻿1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,311
And since you have proven your
commitment

2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:07,575
Boston is now officially open for
the importation of your merchandise.

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:10,620
Jack says just a few more weeks and
you will be free.

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,860
Stories about you come up the canal.

5
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:16,180
Once you walked fine alone,
now you need a stick.

6
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:18,300
You stay clean for two weeks,

7
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:19,980
I'll write Linda another letter.

8
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,180
Have you recently suffered seizures?

9
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:25,004
It is Tuberculoma, I am
afraid it is inoperable.

10
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,380
Mr Shelby.

11
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,780
I only gave opium to your brother

12
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:53,540
because he give me big trouble.

13
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:55,244
He attacked my wife.

14
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:05,884
I would like a pot of green tea, please.

15
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:19,820
It has taken me ten years
to build this business.

16
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:22,604
Your business will be safe,
if you do what I say.

17
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:28,484
How much opium do you have in
your cellar?

18
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:31,580
Five pounds.

19
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:33,564
Bring it to me.

20
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:37,724
Four minutes against the clock.

21
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:11,476
As member of Parliament...

22
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:16,100
...for this constituency...

23
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,226
...it is my duty to take
responsibility for the welfare

24
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,900
- of my constituents.
- Mr Shelby, the clock is still ticking.

25
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:26,060
The consumption of opium is very
prejudicial to health.

26
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:28,180
Women give it to their children
so they can leave

27
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:30,700
them untended while they work
in the factories.

28
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:33,324
Men lose their jobs when they
become addicted.

29
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:37,760
From now on, you will sell

30
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:41,444
only cigarettes, cake and tea.

31
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:45,227
If I hear that you are selling
opium again,

32
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,107
time will indeed run out very
quickly for you. Do you understand?

33
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,747
Yes, I understand, I will stop.

34
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,771
Mr Shelby, the clock is still ticking.

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
_

36
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,740
Please tell...

37
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:05,460
...your suppliers and your customers...

38
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:07,660
...that from now on...

39
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,187
...there will be no more opium...

40
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:15,180
...in Small Heath or in Bordesley.

41
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,371
Thank you for the tea.

42
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:29,660

43
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:33,040
_

44
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:57,107
You can let them through now.

45
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,891
Yes, sir, Mr Shelby.

46
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:04,427
You tell the pub and cafe owners
in Montague Street...

47
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:06,547
...if there is any further trade
in powder,

48
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:08,387
there will be no more Montague Street.

49
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,587
I will have it demolished
and replaced by apartments.

50
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,371
By order of Birmingham Urban
District Council.

52
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:30,667
Sorry I'm late, they closed Montague
Street.

53
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:33,051
There's a gas explosion or...

54
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:39,907
Right. Well, it would be nice if
just one thing

55
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:42,491
could happen in Birmingham that
wasn't our fault.

56
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:50,467
I have gathered you all here today
because there is news

57
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,731
and it is of interest to the whole
family.

58
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:55,827
First of all,

59
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,463
I would like to welcome

60
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:01,371
Finn's new wife Mary to the family.

61
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:07,467
Right. Well, I'm very glad I dragged
myself out of bed for this.

62
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,267
There is...

63
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,147
...one more item of business.

64
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,267
Johnny.

65
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,811
Tom.

66
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:17,731
Come on, come on, hurry up.

67
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,180
Everyone...

68
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,940
...this here is Erasmus.

69
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:32,220
Nobody calls me that.

70
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:34,740
They call him Duke.

71
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:41,227
20 years ago, at Apple by horse fair...

72
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,627
...I met a girl.

73
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,651
We shared the shade of a hazel tree.

74
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:48,731
Nine months later this lad was born.

75
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,260
This is my son.

76
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,307
His mother died on the road.

77
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,667
Up until now I never tried to find him.

78
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:02,900
But I am trying to look at life in a
different way.

79
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:06,900
A child is a precious thing.

80
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,627
So I am bringing him...

81
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:13,027
Into the fucking family with
a snap of his fingers.

82
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:16,307
No, I am bringing him into the fold.

83
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:18,700
He'll have to earn membership of
the family.

84
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:21,987
For the moment, welcome, son.
You have a seat.

85
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,771
Go on, sit down here.

86
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:32,220
There are some mistakes I've made...

87
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,620
...that I can never address...

88
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:36,797
...and some I can.

89
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,587
Some wounds I can try to heal.

90
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:41,811
And new wounds you can open up.

91
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,531
Anyway...

92
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,907
...that's the business of the day.

93
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,931
Is it too early for whisky?

94
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,580
There you go.

95
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:01,667
Shelby breakfast for you, son.

96
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,300
I don't drink.

97
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,467
And I'm not a Shelby, all right?

98
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm a Duke.

99
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:09,267
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo.

100
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,787
You're a fucking Shelby, all right,

101
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:12,500
don't worry about that.

102
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:15,827
Mm, I think we will need Curly

103
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:18,387
and a strong rope to break this one
in, Tom.

104
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,507
Arthur, open up the shop,

105
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:23,427
put the kid here on the blackboard,
writing up the odds.

106
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,060
I can't write.

107
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,491
Put the kid on the blackboard,
wiping off the chalk.

108
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,267
Go on, son.

109
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,011
Come on then.

110
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,851
Lizzie, come on.

111
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:04,547
My father was the Duke of the Saxon
Shore.

112
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:06,387
My mother was a Romany Queen.

113
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:08,660
Who told you that, your mum?

114
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,780
I don't allow people to talk about
my mother.

115
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,747
Good for you.

116
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,467
So let's get this right then,
you can't read,

117
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,867
you can't fucking write,
there's nothing wrong with that.

118
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:23,307
What can you do, eh?

119
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:25,187
I can tell the time.

120
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,587
You can tell the time.

121
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:28,787
Here, he can tell the time.

122
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:30,371
Ain't that clever.

123
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:34,091
It's a lot more than you can fucking do.

124
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,771
What did you just say to me?

125
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:41,931
What time is it, Mr Shelby?

126
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,427
That's what I can do.

127
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:50,451
You little bastard.

128
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:53,987
Here, keep it.

129
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,171
Stop you from being late in the future.

130
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:27,171
Is there forgiveness in your heart
for Arthur Shelby?

131
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:29,820
No.

132
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:35,571
But maybe there will be forgiveness
from God.

133
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:40,587
And you will do God's work?

134
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:43,467
God is interested in you as well, Tommy.

135
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:47,260
And God will be with you on your
journey every step of the way.

136
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,091
He may not need to take many steps.

137
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:08,611
Tell me this, Linda...

138
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:13,180
...is God interested in me...

139
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,530
...or in my money?

140
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,107
I believe you run a foundation

141
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:25,427
and that your foundation has many
missions across the world

142
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,507
but in these times of financial crisis,

143
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:29,507
funding is hard to come by.

144
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:33,347
So perhaps your God's plan is
a practical one.

145
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,747
Perhaps he would like me to make
a donation

146
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:39,708
to your foundation, and in return,

147
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,107
he would like you

148
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:45,220
to help my brother on his road
to redemption.

149
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,987
Now, I know that in a place of
worship such as this,

150
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,227
you would never ask how much.

151
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,380
So I will tell you plainly.

152
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:56,147
I will write your foundation
a cheque for £10,000...

153
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,507
Praise the Lord.

154
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,291
...if you agree to look kindly on
Arthur and to help him.

155
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,140
I need to look after everyone in
the family.

156
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:11,004
Do we have a deal?

157
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,780
Your money will be spent to do good
around the world.

158
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,951
And a mission will be named after you.

159
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:25,180
But I am only agreeing to help him...

160
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,460
...not sleep with him.

161
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:29,300
No.

162
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:33,027
Now, I imagine the negotiation for
that particular favour

163
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:35,620
would take a considerable amount of
time...

164
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,771
...and I have an appointment.

165
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,230
God bless.

166
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:07,531
Apologies for the initial
misunderstanding.

167
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:11,371
My brother dealt with it.

168
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,531
For the care you took.

169
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:23,987
Even though I succumbed to temptation.

170
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,827
Part of the reason my brother is
back dealing with it,

171
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,667
is down to you, you spoke to him.

172
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,107
As a comrade.

173
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:32,728
The beating is still owed to you.

174
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,289
Do you still do that kind of work

175
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,520
yourself, Thomas Shelby, MP?

176
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:41,091
Mr Stagg, see, I can use men like you.

177
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:46,580
I have friends that are in need of guns.

178
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:49,747
Soon, there will be a shipment

179
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:54,507
of Thompson sub machine guns
coming here from Boston.

180
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,850
And I need you to unload
and store those weapons.

181
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,584
There will also be ammunition...

182
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,450
...like this.

183
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,907
You have a good look.

184
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,027
And I need you to take better care
of the guns and ammunition

185
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:13,757
than you did of the powder.

186
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,077
You understand?

187
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,027
Previously,

188
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,747
all of my import and export
went through Belfast docks.

189
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,411
Now we're dealing with Boston...

190
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:32,277
...I am considering shifting
my supply line to Liverpool.

191
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,940
You'll be a very rich man.

192
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:40,620
Don't you ever say thank you?

193
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,417
Thank you.

194
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:06,611
Is that why you do it, Mr Shelby?

195
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:10,707
Is that why you keep all this going?

196
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,771
To have people say thank you?

197
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,427
You could close all this down.

198
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:18,827
You could leave the sport behind.

199
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,267
You could live like
an ordinary mortal man.

200
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,280
On your gravestone,

201
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:26,540
"an ordinary mortal man".

202
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,747
But, instead,

203
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:33,267
you still go round collecting
"please" and "thank you"

204
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,411
and "sorry" and "forgive me, Mr Shelby."

205
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,764
Is that what it's all for?

206
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:43,764
You want to know?

207
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,770
You want to know why I've carried on...

208
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,037
...all these years?

209
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,900
It's so I can do this.

210
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,131
And then...

211
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,890
...do this.

212
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,104
Feel it?

213
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,870
I feel it.

214
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:14,937
Junk doesn't even come close.

215
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,697
Soon, Mr Stagg...

216
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,837
...when my last piece
of business is done...

217
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,611
...I will indeed...

218
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,750
...be an ordinary mortal man.

219
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,390
You have a good day.

220
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:46,627
Arthur,
we've got a problem with a referee.

221
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,147
He's not taking the money.

222
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,867
He's fucking religious or something.

223
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,937
Jesus Christ.

224
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,867
With Tommy away, you're in charge
of gambling, Arthur,

225
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,340
what shall we do?

226
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,187
"And this they said to him,

227
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:04,867
"that they may have some charge
to bring against him."

228
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,147
Arthur,

229
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:08,467
this referee, he's threatening
to go to the police.

230
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:09,780
"Jesus...

231
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,547
"..bent down,

232
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:15,827
"and with one finger,
he wrote on the ground..."

233
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,211
Arthur, brother...

234
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,971
...people are laughing at you.

235
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:28,187
So I just phoned
our Holy referee, again.

236
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:30,587
He basically told me to fuck off.

237
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:32,107
Not even basically, actually,

238
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:35,427
he literally told to me to fuck off.

239
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:39,027
Is that right? So, do you know?

240
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:40,307
Oh, for fuck's sake.

241
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:43,747
Do you know what he wrote
on the ground? Hmm?

242
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,507
- No. No.
- Do you know? You don't know, do yer?

243
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,549
No, I don't.

244
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:47,987
Billy,
do you know what he wrote on the ground?

245
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:49,531
- I...
- Hmm?

246
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:52,667
Do you know what Jesus wrote
on the ground?

247
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:54,107
He bent down,

248
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:57,347
and with one finger,
he wrote on the fucking ground.

249
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,347
You know? Do you know what he wrote?

250
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,627
- Come on, Billy.
- No.

251
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,531
Arthur, what should we do?

252
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:07,107
Go and get me the referee.

253
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,410
Bring me the fucking referee.

254
00:19:18,897 --> 00:19:20,577
I know she's here with us.

255
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:25,031
Always.

256
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:32,517
But still, it's just you and me.

257
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:44,023
I thought it would be good
if we were in a different place.

258
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,499
I hate that house now.

259
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:50,903
I wish I could blow it up.

260
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:03,627
There was a time when we'd say
nothing afterwards

261
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:06,611
because we didn't have to say anything.

262
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:12,984
But now we've got nothing left to say.

263
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,637
There's business.

264
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,317
What business?

265
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,091
The American.

266
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,730
He's coming to Birmingham.

267
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,590
He's stopping over
on his way to Liverpool.

268
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:39,887
He is staying with us tomorrow night.

269
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,787
Frances knows.

270
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:43,460
She's making up a menu.

271
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,891
And then...

272
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:51,940
...we have to make a move.

273
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,417
Do you want to know
what that move is, Lizzie?

274
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:01,051
No.

275
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:04,817
I know enough.

276
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:10,697
Your book of regrets.

277
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,380
23, 24,

278
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,650
52, 55.

279
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,090
The combination to the safe.

280
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,091
Regrets.

281
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:31,900
And I'm on there.

282
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,820
I'm on the list.

283
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:37,660
On the very top of the list.

284
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:44,517
Yep.

285
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:47,051
Yes, you are.

286
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,270
I regret marrying you, Lizzie.

287
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,651
Cos I've put you through so much.

288
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:02,460
I've put you through all of this. Ruby.

289
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:06,651
Everything that is to come.

290
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,571
When you married me, you married
a man and you married a curse.

291
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:16,251
You have shared my fate.

292
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,417
That is my regret.

293
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:27,171
But know this, Lizzie.

294
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:30,587
In this moment,

295
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:32,364
in this room...

296
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:36,257
...I love you.

297
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:46,187
You sound like
you're ticking a fucking box,

298
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,611
and I don't know what's inside the box.

299
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:55,623
Never have you let me in.

300
00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:00,580
Even though I know
the combination to the safe.

301
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,107
Oh, this is him, is it?

302
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:45,587
The one who likes
to be fucking difficult, eh?

303
00:23:45,611 --> 00:23:48,347
When I leave this place,
I am going straight to the police.

304
00:23:48,371 --> 00:23:50,787
- You are?
- This man pointed a gun at me.

305
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:52,851
- Who, him there?
- Yeah.

306
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:56,787
Well, let's phone the police, eh?

307
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:01,187
Don't worry. We'll have this
sorted out for you.

308
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:04,907
Hello? Yes, get me the police.

309
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:07,678
Reports of a man with
a revolver on Watery Lane.

310
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:09,987
There you go.

311
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:12,027
And you ask for Inspector Moss.

312
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:16,987
Chief Superintendent Moss.

313
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,907
He's in charge of Watery Lane
and Bordesley Green.

314
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:23,347
That's right.

315
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:24,700
And you see this?

316
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:29,500
That's his betting credit with us.

317
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:34,580
He makes a lot of money
from football matches.

318
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:39,260
Because we give him
the results before the match.

319
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:51,067
On Saturday afternoon,

320
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:53,347
you take this whistle, and you blow.

321
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,507
You give a penalty to
Birmingham City in the final minute.

322
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:58,987
The goalkeeper will let
the penalty go by him,

323
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:01,867
and Birmingham City will win 1-0.

324
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,387
All you got to do is...

325
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,770
No.

326
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,907
I won't do it.

327
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,387
If the police won't listen,
I'll go to the newspapers.

328
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,531
I'm not afraid.

329
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:24,627
I was in France.

330
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:26,380
Phone Tommy, Arthur.

331
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:28,980
You shut up.

332
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:33,547
I am not phoning fucking Tommy.
I am dealing with this, OK?

333
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,347
- I'm leaving.
- You are going fucking nowhere.

334
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:38,547
It's time one of us stood up
to you people.

335
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,380
It's not right what's been happening.

336
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:44,147
I will not take money to cheat.

337
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,867
Fucking hell.

338
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,947
In France, I ran at the wire.

339
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:50,837
And I was not afraid.

340
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,786
I am not afraid.

341
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,180
I won't do a bad thing.

342
00:25:58,051 --> 00:25:59,971
I have seen too many bad things.

343
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,790
A beating will make no difference.

344
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,867
I know that,

345
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:09,467
cos I can see it in your fucking eyes.

346
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:11,348
Fuck.

347
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,547
In the bleak midwinter...

348
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:16,307
Holy Mary, mother of God.

349
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:17,907
Ah!

350
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:19,627
Right, Billy Boy.

351
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:21,987
You've been in the family long enough.

352
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:24,787
Yeah. It's time for you to get bloodied.

353
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:26,787
- Arthur, you can't.
- Arthur, please.

354
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:27,867
You've been with us long enough.

355
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:30,067
Arthur, fuck, Jesus Christ.

356
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:32,707
I can't be that man. Arthur, please.

357
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:35,107
Either two men die today, Billy...

358
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:36,971
...or one. You fucking decide.

359
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:40,011
You hate him, Billy. You hate him.

360
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:42,467
You don't know him Billy.

361
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:44,307
He's fucking laughing at you.

362
00:26:44,331 --> 00:26:45,747
Come on, hate him.

363
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,587
Look him in the eyes, man.

364
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,667
Look him in the eyes.

365
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,667
- I can't. I can't.
- Look him in the eyes.

366
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:53,867
I'm sorry... sorry.

367
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:00,251
A a a a ah!

368
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,427
Enough. Enough, enough, enough.

369
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:12,547
All right. Billy B, come on.

370
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:14,107
Come on, sh...

371
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,947
Sh, sh...

372
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,691
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

373
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:23,827
Look at you. Look...

374
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,427
Look at you, look.

375
00:27:25,451 --> 00:27:26,571
Huh?

376
00:27:28,451 --> 00:27:30,731
You're bloodied now, Billy.

377
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,097
You're bloodied now.

378
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,067
You're not going to heaven no more.

379
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,810
They won't let you in.

380
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,587
Isiah, you take him to the foundry.

381
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,427
And you ask for Mr Patches, all right?

382
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:50,851
You tell him
we got some fuel for the furnace.

383
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:21,651
Who the fuck are you?

384
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,531
Ah! Ah!

385
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:30,347
- I hear...
- Please.

386
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:33,651
...you're the informant
inside the Shelby organisation.

387
00:29:35,411 --> 00:29:37,467
And who the fuck I am...

388
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:39,707
...is the man who you now work for.

389
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:41,747
Please, please...

390
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,147
I have some things I need you to do,
and I want to impress upon you...

391
00:29:45,171 --> 00:29:46,467
- To IMPRESS...
- Ah! Ah!

392
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:50,749
...upon you
the seriousness of my intent.

393
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:54,877
Cos, you see, I used to do
this kind of thing for a living.

394
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,780
And sometimes I kind of miss it.

395
00:29:59,571 --> 00:30:02,667
Just like Mr Shelby,
I miss the... the wave

396
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:04,827
of electricity you get under your scalp.

397
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:08,260
I miss the taste like metal
on the tip of your tongue.

398
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:11,107
I am about to give you an instruction.

399
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:12,987
You do as I say,

400
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,907
you stay a man.

401
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,347
Fail,

402
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:20,091
and I will send people to serve
your balls to you on a china plate.

403
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:24,704
I'll do what you say.

404
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:28,387
A decision has been taken.

405
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,387
My associates are going to take care
of Tommy Shelby.

406
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,347
And you are going to give us up
his brother, Arthur.

407
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:38,308
Do you understand?

408
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:41,491
Yes... Yes. Fucking yes. Please.

409
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:49,347
Only information leading
to the murder of Arthur Shelby

410
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:52,107
will save you from an Italian death.

411
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,747
Cos it was the Italians
that taught me that

412
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,187
above God, above children,

413
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,460
above his wife and above his mother...

414
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:02,931
...most of all, a man loves his balls.

415
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:01,703
Oh...

416
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:15,758
Hello, Arthur.

417
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:29,337
I think we should pray.

418
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:32,827
That's how we begin this.

419
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,347
You'd like to pray?

420
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,971
The prayer I have chosen is
the Act of Contrition, version two.

421
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,987
So, you're Catholic now, Linda?

422
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,917
You're Catholic. Quakers don't pray.

423
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,180
Bow your head, Arthur,
and close your eyes.

424
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:54,427
And recite the prayer.

425
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:56,107
You know it well from when you were boy.

426
00:32:56,131 --> 00:32:58,907
Oh, my mind's all dried up
with junk, though,

427
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:00,467
and shot full of fuck...

428
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:02,140
Shot full of holes.

429
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:06,977
Linda, please.

430
00:33:08,171 --> 00:33:11,107
It's in there somewhere, Arthur.
It's like a song.

431
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:12,251
Yeah.

432
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,747
Somewhere.

433
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:16,307
Together, we'll find it.

434
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,100
Digging for the words
will help clean your soul.

435
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:22,137
I'll begin it.

436
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:28,147
Forgive me my sins, oh, Lord,
forgive me my sins.

437
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:29,531
The sins of my youth.

438
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:33,427
The sins of my youth,
the sins of my age,

439
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:35,060
the sins of my soul.

440
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,500
The sins of my body.

441
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:42,740
The sins I know, the sins I know not.

442
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,107
The sins I have concealed for so long.

443
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:48,307
For so fu...

444
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:49,864
For so long.

445
00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:11,780
I caught him stealing a car.

446
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:14,780
And he's got a stack of cash
from the betting shop.

447
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:30,067
Steal from who you want,

448
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:31,500
but don't steal from me.

449
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:35,371
Here you are.

450
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:40,707
Get a train to wherever
the fuck you want to go. Get out.

451
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:42,860
- I don't ride trains.
- Is that a fact?

452
00:34:46,077 --> 00:34:47,837
Well, Curly has a two-wheeled wagon.

453
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:50,387
What am I, a tinker?

454
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:52,100
I need four wheels.

455
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,890
And a horse for the hills.

456
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:59,500
Which hills?

457
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,140
All of them. All the hills of England.

458
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:09,180
Why do you want to leave?

459
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,371
I didn't take to that work
in the betting shop.

460
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:21,060
Well, you heard him, Charlie.

461
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:24,787
Get my dad's old four-wheeled wagon
and two strong ponies.

462
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:26,500
Right.

463
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:29,571
Curly! Get here.

464
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,787
Before you go,

465
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:38,851
do you want to know the truth
about yourself?

466
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,020
No. Who does?

467
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,420
Well, I am going to tell yer.

468
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:48,987
That spring at Apple by Fair,

469
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:51,107
your mother stole my watch and chain.

470
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:53,100
You're from a long line of thieves.

471
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:57,827
The watch had the words
"Saxon Shore" carved in it.

472
00:35:57,851 --> 00:36:00,820
I stole it myself
from a drunk when I was a kid.

473
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:03,187
I imagine she told you

474
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,187
your dad was
the Duke of the Saxon Shore.

475
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:06,867
Well...

476
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,027
...I am the Duke,

477
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:10,660
it was my watch.

478
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,331
I am your father.

479
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:15,931
That's the truth.

480
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:18,347
When her dad found out,

481
00:36:18,371 --> 00:36:20,091
he shot me in the chest
with a squirrel gun.

482
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:26,931
A scar and a stolen watch
and a story she made up.

483
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:30,387
That's all you need to know
about yourself

484
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:31,931
before you get on the road.

485
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:46,731
Esme told me the spirits favour you.

486
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,307
That the spirit is in you.

487
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,011
She tried to sell me like one
of those horses, didn't she?

488
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:56,347
How much did she pay for me?

489
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,867
I have no use for gold any more.

490
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,827
But if you're a horse,

491
00:37:02,363 --> 00:37:04,123
you're in the right place.

492
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,270
Curly!

493
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:10,180
Curly. Hurry up.

494
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:12,691
This boy has hills to climb.

495
00:37:15,997 --> 00:37:17,277
I remember that watch.

496
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,370
Oh, yeah?

497
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:24,411
She used to wear it over her heart.

498
00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:29,460
We buried it with her.

499
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:36,387
Tom. The old wagon's
right front wheel is fucked, Tom.

500
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:37,731
It's standing in the wet.

501
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,331
Put a new one on, Curly.

502
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:44,743
Yeah.

503
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,650
They fix wagons here.

504
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:52,907
Good families come from the New Forest

505
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:54,907
to have their wagons fixed

506
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,370
and get fresh horses before the fairs.

507
00:38:00,523 --> 00:38:02,963
Yeah. Yeah, I like it here.

508
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,811
I like it better than that betting shop.

509
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:10,180
Why?

510
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,180
People.

511
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,380
People piss me off.

512
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:18,291
There are a lot of people
in that betting shop.

513
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,507
So far, here I've only counted two.

514
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:23,860
Uh-huh.

515
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,547
Charlie and Curly,

516
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,387
the rest is dogs and horses.

517
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:29,220
Curly's half horse himself.

518
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,923
Dogs are OK.

519
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:34,691
Horses are better than people, mind you.

520
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,757
There's work here
for a man who knows horses.

521
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:45,371
Unknown.

522
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,540
I want to remain completely unknown.

523
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:51,307
Well, you'd be in the right place
for that as well.

524
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,491
No-one knows anyone here.

525
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:56,611
Hey, mister. Save that wheel a minute.

526
00:38:58,731 --> 00:38:59,971
Where would I stay?

527
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:04,980
Stables, with the other stallions.

528
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:07,947
Now that Finn is married off,

529
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,987
there are plenty of girls round here.

530
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:13,464
Their fathers are mostly unarmed.

531
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:19,484
I have a future for you, Duke.

532
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:22,851
You already have a son.

533
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,597
My business has two sides.

534
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,091
Light and dark.

535
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:32,060
I'll need someone for each.

536
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:35,100
And I'm dark, am I?

537
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:39,204
I have realised we don't get
to choose which one we are.

538
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:42,063
Dark knows dark.

539
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:46,097
And my affairs, both light and dark...

540
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,990
...will need settling soon.

541
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,187
Curly? Find a shovel for
the Duke of the Saxon Shore here.

542
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,027
Get him shovelling shit.

543
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:01,347
And put some petrol in the boat.

544
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:03,617
I'm off to meet a lady in Solihull.

545
00:40:43,131 --> 00:40:44,291
Take a look at her.

546
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,943
Now imagine ten people living on side.

547
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,450
Step on. Have a look inside.

548
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:01,387
I've had a response
from the Guinness Trust

549
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:05,547
about building charitable housing
at two sites

550
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:09,427
along the canal network between London,

551
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:11,187
Birmingham and Liverpool.

552
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,100
This lock here would be
the one of the sites.

553
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:19,540
I have the permission.
We just need the finance.

554
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:24,987
I know that you and your husband,
Bryan Guinness, are estranged,

555
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:27,667
but I understand
you still have influence

556
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:29,500
in the Guinness family.

557
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:32,667
Your support might help them
make their decision.

558
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,131
Will you help me?

559
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:46,056
I've booked a suite in a hotel
a mile from here.

560
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:48,971
My chauffeur will take us there.

561
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,907
You look quite the thing
dressed like that,

562
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:54,707
dressed like a working man.

563
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:56,547
They'll probably show you
to the coal house

564
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:58,627
to make your delivery.

565
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,384
Yep, they probably will.

566
00:42:04,297 --> 00:42:06,353
Oswald has fucked your wife,

567
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:09,277
so my suggestion is
about balance and proportion.

568
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,430
It would be only fair.

569
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:16,684
Can I assume...

570
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,170
...I have your support?

571
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:27,307
This isn't about charitable housing,
this is about changing the world.

572
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:30,147
It's about a different kind of trust.

573
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:31,611
Absolute trust.

574
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,651
We have important work ahead of us.

575
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,547
It's much harder to lie

576
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:40,131
with your body than with your words.

577
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:42,917
This, I have learnt.

578
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:52,940
Mostly, I do whatever I want to do.

579
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:56,667
Sometimes, I do things for the cause.

580
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:58,620
In this case, it's both.

581
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:02,951
Come.

582
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:31,267
In the interests of absolute clarity,

583
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,867
that is simply

584
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:35,620
the English aristocracy's way
of shaking hands.

585
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,610
So...

586
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:42,660
Welcome.

587
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,251
If you do this thing...

588
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:34,411
...the possibility of war,
you have to consider.

589
00:46:40,011 --> 00:46:41,347
It was the ambitions

590
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:43,371
and strategies of one man
that caused this.

591
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:50,467
There will be a war in this family.

592
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:52,667
And one of you will die.

593
00:47:18,131 --> 00:47:21,827
We need to leave early to catch
the first train to Liverpool, yes?

594
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:23,347
Yep.

595
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:25,917
So eat early, finish early.

596
00:47:30,811 --> 00:47:32,700
You changed the combination of the safe.

597
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:35,498
Why?

598
00:47:36,051 --> 00:47:37,700
Have you got new secrets?

599
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:40,987
With the new business at hand,

600
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,067
there are some things

601
00:47:44,091 --> 00:47:45,787
that I cannot share.

602
00:47:45,811 --> 00:47:47,540
What things?

603
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:54,507
What are those tablets?

604
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,427
The doctor gave them me.

605
00:47:56,451 --> 00:47:57,987
Pain killers?

606
00:47:58,011 --> 00:48:00,500
- Yeah.
- What pain?

607
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,457
Any pain that comes, Lizzie.

608
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:29,359
When you're ready, I want you
to tell me everything

609
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:30,624
that's going on.

610
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:35,267
It's like the clock's stopped ticking

611
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,411
and I'm waiting for the bomb to explode.

612
00:48:41,817 --> 00:48:43,617
We are in that quiet minute.

613
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:51,671
Tommy?

614
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,790
That's where we live now.

615
00:49:03,697 --> 00:49:05,337
When I know everything...

616
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:08,844
...I will tell you everything.

617
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:27,587
Oh, no, Gina's running wild, y'see.

618
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:30,267
Harrods, dope, amphetamines,
lords and ladies,

619
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:32,307
you know, the whole
English aristocracy thing.

620
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:34,067
Fuck wine, whiskey.

621
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,107
Shelby, you having whiskey?

622
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:37,347
I'll stay on wine.

623
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:40,467
Fuck wine, more whiskey.
I'm celebrating.

624
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:43,827
Celebration, you know.
Getting off this fucking island.

625
00:49:43,851 --> 00:49:45,267
You see, the thing with England,

626
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:47,707
the currency here, it's not money.

627
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:50,620
Nah. You got bored of money
a long time ago.

628
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:53,147
Cos you know anyone can have money,

629
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:54,251
you can fucking...

630
00:49:57,491 --> 00:50:00,187
...you can fucking find money
in the mud.

631
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,060
You can forge money.

632
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:04,891
Mr Shelby, you can steal money,
am I right?

633
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,937
The currency here, it's blood.

634
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:14,667
And Mr Shelby knows that
better than all of them.

635
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:16,267
Blood here is like wine,

636
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:19,467
like the vintage wine
in that bottle. It's the label,

637
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:22,467
it's the terroir,
it's the grape that makes the wine.

638
00:50:22,491 --> 00:50:25,107
Who fucking cares
about the glass around it?

639
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:27,667
And you, my friend, you're an American.

640
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,947
You fucking smash the glass,

641
00:50:29,971 --> 00:50:31,387
you spill the blood

642
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,900
and you spend their currency
to get what you want.

643
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,510
Am I right?

644
00:50:38,531 --> 00:50:40,620
When you come to America,

645
00:50:41,011 --> 00:50:43,187
I will show you things.

646
00:50:43,211 --> 00:50:44,531
You're going to America?

647
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:50,627
To Canada, Lizzie,
to collect payment for the shipment.

648
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,220
I need to do it myself.

649
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:55,467
And who will be going with you?

650
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:58,067
Michael will be there to watch his back.

651
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:00,660
Another journey, Tommy?

652
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:02,667
$5 million, Mrs Shelby.

653
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:04,731
It's worth a little cruise,
don't you think?

654
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,227
You know whiskey does talk, Mr Nelson,

655
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:15,780
and sometimes
whiskey is... very eloquent.

656
00:51:17,731 --> 00:51:21,651
But $5 million, Mr Nelson...

657
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,004
Now, that is a legacy.

658
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,944
And when I come back,
I will know everything.

659
00:51:33,384 --> 00:51:38,384
I see myself so clearly
in you, Thomas Shelby.

660
00:51:39,691 --> 00:51:42,827
You are a man with a bright
and glittering future.

661
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:48,947
Mr Shelby,
there's a car coming up the drive.

662
00:51:48,971 --> 00:51:50,507
A Rolls-Royce.

663
00:51:50,531 --> 00:51:52,260
Were you expecting more guests?

664
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:55,251
No.

665
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:04,017
Excuse me.

666
00:52:11,891 --> 00:52:14,227
We were on our way
to my constituency in Smethwick

667
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:16,667
and I heard our American friend
was in Birmingham

668
00:52:16,691 --> 00:52:18,467
and that he was coming here,

669
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:22,260
so we came to say one last farewell.

670
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:27,884
Champagne. We have much to celebrate.

671
00:52:36,091 --> 00:52:38,347
It isn't that I wasn't sure
Mr Shelby would give you

672
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:41,187
an excellent send-off, I just felt,

673
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:43,787
since telegrams and wires

674
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:47,267
and letters can so easily
be intercepted,

675
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:50,027
we might confirm all that
we've achieved during your visit

676
00:52:50,051 --> 00:52:51,531
over champagne.

677
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:56,227
It is remarkable how quickly
our relationships have developed.

678
00:52:56,251 --> 00:52:58,907
So many triangles in this room.

679
00:52:59,257 --> 00:53:02,577
Everyone except from Mr Nelson
is the point of a triangle.

680
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:05,867
How am I part of a triangle?

681
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:10,027
Mr Nelson,
you have all that you came for?

682
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:12,387
I have confirmation
that the future of Europe is in

683
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:15,027
the hands of men like yourselves.

684
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,267
And that urgent conversations
between Washington,

685
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:22,460
Rome and of course Berlin can now begin.

686
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:26,740
A two-week visit that may have
changed the course of history.

687
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:29,467
We have all got what we wanted.

688
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:31,067
Yes.

689
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,771
And I got what I have wanted
from the moment I set eyes on it.

690
00:53:40,357 --> 00:53:43,677
Elizabeth, you are a very lucky woman...

691
00:53:44,524 --> 00:53:48,204
...to have each day
what I have only sampled once.

692
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,667
Forgive us, Mr Nelson,

693
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:14,740
that was a necessary bit
of housekeeping.

694
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:21,584
Thomas.

695
00:54:23,171 --> 00:54:25,107
We do so hate to be indiscreet,

696
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:28,387
but we have told you many times,

697
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:33,267
if you are to seek power
in these days of shiny magazines

698
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:35,747
and society photographs,

699
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,811
sooner or later, you will have to
find a spouse who is more suitable.

700
00:54:40,491 --> 00:54:42,427
A woman with Lizzie's past

701
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:44,891
and personal history
really isn't suitable.

702
00:54:47,657 --> 00:54:49,617
She doesn't deserve you, Mr Shelby.

703
00:55:13,691 --> 00:55:15,531
You know the thing is, Mosley...

704
00:55:17,164 --> 00:55:18,380
...you're right.

705
00:55:21,371 --> 00:55:23,140
You're right, she doesn't deserve me.

706
00:55:28,164 --> 00:55:29,644
She doesn't deserve what I am.

707
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:34,707
She doesn't deserve what I will become.

708
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,980
What will you become?

709
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:40,307
The truth is, I belong here,
at this table.

710
00:55:40,331 --> 00:55:42,011
With fuckers like you.

711
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:46,237
She doesn't.

712
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,630
For all I try to hide it...

713
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,946
...I'm just one of you.

714
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:01,987
Could there be a sadder ending, eh?

715
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:05,707
I'm here on behalf of your wife,
Gina, and Jack Nelson.

716
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:08,977
Mr Nelson's prepared
to get you out of here.

717
00:57:09,411 --> 00:57:12,011
But first he needs an answer
to the question.

718
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:15,091
If the answer is yes...

719
00:57:16,857 --> 00:57:17,977
...you'll be released.

720
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:21,451
If the answer is no...

721
00:57:22,904 --> 00:57:24,144
...you'll stay.

722
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:28,771
I have consulted my mother.

723
00:57:30,144 --> 00:57:31,424
Your mother's dead.

724
00:57:33,771 --> 00:57:35,531
Never the less, I have consulted her.

725
00:57:39,317 --> 00:57:40,357
And yes.

726
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:43,187
When I'm released,

727
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:45,340
it is my intention to kill Tommy Shelby.
