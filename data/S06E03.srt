﻿1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,060
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

2
00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:04,933
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

3
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:06,327
Fascists.

4
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:08,409
Not the ones in boots and black shirts.

5
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,938
The ones in tuxedos.

6
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:12,259
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

7
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:14,859
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

8
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:17,739
Officially he's coming to buy
liquor import licenses.

9
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:20,619
And unofficially he's Roosevelt's envoy.

10
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:23,351
By being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

11
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,758
I can undermine them.

12
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:26,630
Still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

13
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:28,283
If you don't want
to help me carry the bucket,

14
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:29,619
then I wouldn't blame you.

15
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:31,579
You have to carry this bucket
on your own.

16
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:33,139
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

17
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:34,443
You're a brave man.

18
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,299
Every war hero I ever met,

19
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:39,939
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

20
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:41,688
If anyone is going
to kill Tommy Shelby...

21
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:42,859
It will be you.

22
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:46,275
The devil will be dead.
The future belongs to us.

23
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,805
You need to see a doctor.

24
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,326
We've got to keep going until
the Boston business is done.

25
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,968
Hello?

26
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:56,699
Tommy, she has a temperature of 101
and nothing is working.

27
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,900
Just get here now.

28
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:22,259
Out of the way! Out of the way!

29
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:25,099
- No... no. Where's the doctor?
- Can you get the doctor?

30
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:26,979
- I need to speak a doctor.
- Mr Shelby.

31
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,619
Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.

32
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:31,659
Consumption
is a very infectious disease.

33
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,019
There are procedures
that must be followed.

34
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,945
- Please, hand over the child.
- OK.

35
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:36,939
Lizzie?

36
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,339
It's going to be all right.

37
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,059
Right, you take her. You be gentle.

38
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:42,858
Look after her.

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,419
That's my daughter, you hear me?

40
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:46,979
I need to be with her.

41
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:49,179
I need to be with my daughter!

42
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:50,419
Tom.

43
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,019
OK. Come on. They are X-raying Ruby,
they have to X-ray us

44
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:56,579
- because we might have it as well.
- Fuck us, Lizzie.

45
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:58,859
Fuck us! Fuck you and me!

46
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:00,603
Who brought this on?

47
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:04,739
We brought on this curse.

48
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:06,739
Stop, Tommy.

49
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:08,302
Fucking stop!

50
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,289
They wouldn't let me pass.

51
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:13,660
They wouldn't let me pass.

52
00:02:15,283 --> 00:02:18,780
They did it on purpose, to punish me.

53
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,819
Tommy, stop it, please.

54
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,260
All right.

55
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,466
All right.

56
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:32,419
My husband is very sorry.

57
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,899
OK.

58
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:39,140
My husband is very sorry
and he is calm now.

59
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:45,062
He is recovering from addiction.
Sometimes...

60
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,042
Sometimes...

61
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:52,795
...he's a horse in a crate,
kicking the crate.

62
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,022
It's just the crate I'm kicking.

63
00:02:58,282 --> 00:02:59,602
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,939
- Lizzie.
- Yeah?

65
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:04,619
Tell me what I have to do.

66
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,763
- This way, sir.
- Sorry.

67
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:11,083
Thank you.

68
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:22,469
Mr Shelby, you will need to
keep still for a moment.

69
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:38,603
To see what's inside.

70
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,176
Wait till you see.

71
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:46,736
God.

72
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,575
God knows what's inside.

73
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,043
God help her.

74
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:32,540
She has a tubercular infection
in her left lung.

75
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:35,416
They've caught it quite early.

76
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:38,295
They'll do more tests.

77
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:44,499
They do this thing, pulmonary something,

78
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:47,299
where they collapse the lung,
let it rest.

79
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:49,460
Sometimes the lung cures itself.

80
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:54,339
And if that doesn't work, they use gold.

81
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,780
What?

82
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:59,899
- Gold?
- Gold salts.

83
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,179
The doctor said he explained
their methods to you

84
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:04,979
when you cut the ribbon to open
the institution.

85
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:07,259
I can't remember, I wasn't listening.

86
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:08,780
Yeah, well.

87
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,219
Gold salts.

88
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,523
Salt with 37% gold.

89
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:22,682
They say it helps, but it will
make her more sick at first.

90
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:35,220
Did they say what...?

91
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:38,299
Did they say what the chances are?

92
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:41,260
- No. They don't say.
- Hm.

93
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:43,059
But she's small.

94
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,699
And with TB that's not good
because the disease is big and fast.

95

96
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:31,940
I'm so sorry, my darling.

97
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:37,882
But I will deal with it.

98
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,902
I will make it go away.

99
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,662
I will strike a bargain.

100
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:57,242
You should be wearing a mask.

101
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:00,176
I am.

102
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,129
You can try gold,
I will try something else.

103
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,643
Mayfair 244.

104
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:39,179
Ada. Listen to me.

105
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,979
I need you to be me in London.

106
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,513
No, it's important.

107
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,899
I know you want nothing to do
with my business,

108
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,379
but Ruby is very sick.

109
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:50,456
I need five days of your time.

110
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,416
So she dresses well.

111
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:12,899
- Go to the door and take her coat.
- Yes, ma'am.

112
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:16,299
Uh... and make a note of the label.

113
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,116
Of course, ma'am.

114
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:49,643
Oh, Thomas, where the devil are you?

115
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:07,340
Mrs Ada Thorne, ma'am.

116
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:11,379
- I thought you were all called Shelby.
- Ah, I'm a widow.

117
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,099
My husband didn't have the
good grace to die. He lingers yet.

118
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:18,259
Your husband is a member of
the Guinness family, I believe.

119
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,499
They do a lot of good work on behalf
of the poor.

120
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:22,179
The poor who are only poor because

121
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:25,339
they spent so much of their income
on Guinness. Please.

122
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:29,179
I think the causes of poverty are
a little more complex than that.

123
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:31,443
Yes. I believe it is to do
with genetics.

124
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:34,419
Huh. Beautiful vase.

125
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:37,339
My grandfather stole it from
a brothel in Cairo.

126
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:40,419
Egyptian. The 18th Dynasty, I think.

127
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:42,899
How do you know so much about
Egyptian vases?

128
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:44,923
- I collect antiques.
- Hm.

129
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:50,179
A tribe of Gypsies settles on
a clearing in a factory town.

130
00:10:50,203 --> 00:10:52,939
Children, of course,
ensue in their hundreds,

131
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,019
but one of them becomes
a gangster and a politician,

132
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:57,739
the other a collector of antiques.

133
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,459
It is quite extraordinary.

134
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,083
A result of genetics, I think.

135
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,859
My dear, you researched me
and I researched you.

136
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:08,052
If this was 1919, you would have
come through my front door

137
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:10,299
carrying a revolver
and a Molotov cocktail

138
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:12,299
and would happily have blown off
my head.

139
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:15,139
Hm, isn't it wonderful how time
changes everything?

140
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:16,820
- Where is the American?
- He'll be here later.

141
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:17,835
Where is Mosley?

142
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:19,859
He heard Thomas wasn't
coming so he decided to sulk.

143
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:22,043
You know how men are. Where is Thomas?

144
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,939
His daughter is sick.

145
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,219
Does he not employ a Governess?

146
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,339
It's a class thing, a genetic thing.

147
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:32,859
He puts his daughter's welfare
before business.

148
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:34,939
Even the business of changing the world.

149
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,939
I thought today was purely social.

150
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,099
Now that it's just you,
I suppose it will be.

151
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:46,936
You should know your brother
has altered my life.

152
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:52,579
The men here just bounce up and down
in their saddles in a rising trot,

153
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:54,299
never even galloping.

154
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,379
Thomas is the man on the horse
on the vase.

155
00:11:57,403 --> 00:11:59,403
That's why I put it out for you
to look at.

156
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,339
According to recent interpretations,

157
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:07,619
the black rider on 18th Dynasty
vases is meant to signify

158
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,219
approaching death.

159
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:12,740
So, yes, I suppose it resembles Thomas.

160
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,619
Tell me, why is he so emotionally
mutilated?

161
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:20,099
Oh. Because he is a character in
a novel, of course.

162
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:24,179
One of those novels ladies like you
like to read. All about wild men.

163
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,699
Oh, I don't read novels,

164
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,140
I read only pornography and politics.

165
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:33,304
In the absence of the men, shouldn't
we ladies be engaging

166
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:34,435
in small talk?

167
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,169
Very well. Small talk.

168
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:53,339
You know I like to fuck women
as well as men.

169
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:57,859
Mm, Tommy was right.

170
00:12:57,883 --> 00:13:00,419
He says that everything is a circle.

171
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:04,979
A lady in Eaton Square, as coarse
and honest as an Aston whore.

172
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,963
I just realised I haven't even
offered you a drink.

173
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:19,259
Ada. Before the dreary business
of changing the world begins,

174
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:20,763
I want you to know something.

175
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:25,339
When the time comes for
the great cleansing,

176
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:27,659
I myself will personally argue the case

177
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,558
that the Jews must be dealt with,

178
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:31,339
but that the Gypsies should be spared.

179
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:32,763
Huh.

180
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:36,700
Let's drink whisky
and wait for the American.

181
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,483
Huh.

182
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:28,043
Who the fuck are you?

183
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:37,739
I am the owner of this Colt pistol
and the bullets within it.

184
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:39,469
And I am in a hurry.

185
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:43,220
I followed the patrin signs
for the Lee family.

186
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:46,899
I'm looking for Esme Shelby-Lee.

187
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:48,363
Never heard of her.

188
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:53,643
_

189
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,620
_

190
00:14:57,403 --> 00:15:00,779
Esme's husband
was a fucking dirty Didicoi.

191
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:03,819
- He was a Peaky Blinder.
- Yeah?

192
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:06,299
Well, I'm the elder and more terrible.

193
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:08,342
And as I said, I'm in a hurry.

194
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,629
Where is she?

195
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:34,340
Put your gun away, Thomas,
there's children around.

196
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:43,899
You only found me cos I let you find me.

197
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:46,460
I heard you were looking,
and I'm curious.

198
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:54,819
If any of these men is your man,
please tell him I want no trouble.

199
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:56,382
I don't have a man.

200
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,003
What use is a man?

201
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:03,580
A horse pulls the wagon.
A dog keeps me safe.

202
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:06,036
A cat keeps me warm at night.

203
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:12,459
And if anybody's going to give you
trouble, Tommy Shelby. It'll be me.

204
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:13,883
What do you want?

205
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:17,403
Tell them to leave.

206
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:20,819
What, you think I'm in charge here?

207
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:22,243
Oh, I'm sure of it, Esme.

208
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:25,560
_

209
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,169
_

210
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,929
Didicoi's too grand to put his arse
on the grass these days?

211
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:03,078
I have a daughter, Esme.

212
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:04,619
Her name is Ruby.

213
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:06,579
She's fallen ill suddenly.

214
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:08,529
She's very sick.

215
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:15,140
And I can tell by saying her name
and looking in your eyes

216
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:18,162
that I have wasted petrol,
time and hope.

217
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:20,849
Wasted petrol on what?

218
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,449
Ah...

219
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:28,739
Tommy Shelby, OBE MP.

220
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,459
Running round the mountains in

221
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,523
pursuit of a Gypsy curse, is that it?

222
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:36,652
I thought you had
Polly deal with the spirits.

223
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:37,869
Polly is dead.

224
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:42,940
Bullet or a blade?

225
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,490
Still speaks to me in my dreams.

226
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,523
It was her who told me to come find you.

227
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,843
Polly.

228
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,939
That name like the ringing of
the school bell.

229
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:00,540
Come and do as you're told.

230
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,275
Oh, fuck!

231
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:06,436
I am so glad I'm not in your camp
any more.

232
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,356
Made of bricks and bars.

233
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:13,019
My daughter is dying, Esme.

234
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,339
Some people go to France.

235
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:17,059
To Lourdes. I hear they sell trinkets.

236
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,603
I need more than fucking trinkets.

237
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:24,939
I can tell from your reaction
this is not your doing.

238
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,770
I'm sorry for troubling you.

239
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:49,379
The butler says our American friend
is parking the car.

240
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:52,219
He also says, in answer to
your inquiry, Diana,

241
00:18:52,243 --> 00:18:55,443
that the coat our exotic friend
is wearing is made by Chanel.

242
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,019
- That's a very expensive label.
- Yes, it is.

243
00:19:01,043 --> 00:19:03,540
But the perfume
I can smell on you is very cheap.

244
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,899
I am deeply, deeply annoyed
that Thomas isn't here.

245
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,619
It is a family emergency, apparently.

246
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,009
We only have Ada. The sister.

247
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:23,939
Well, would the sister like
some more Champagne?

248
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,859
Oh, the sister is allowed to speak?

249
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:27,899
She thinks this lunch is purely social.

250
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:32,379
The sister is here because there's
sickness in the family.

251
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:34,979
Thomas wanted someone from
the Shelby organisation

252
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:36,459
to introduce Mr Nelson to you

253
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:39,179
and to offer all three of you
an invitation.

254
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,859
Ooh. What invitation?

255
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:44,619
The invitation can wait.

256
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,699
And please remember, in this moment,
in this room,

257
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:50,099
it is the Shelby family
that holds the power,

258
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,099
because we have the information
and the incentives

259
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:56,499
that will make Mr Nelson do
what you require him to do.

260
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:59,546
So when I speak, please keep
your fucking mouths closed,

261
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,619
because, although I'm reluctant,
I am actually quite good at this.

262
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,659
And yes, I will have Champagne.

263
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,819
- Ah.
- Take care of this.

264
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:16,539
OK, so before these dull
introductions begin,

265
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:19,511
I just have to tell you something
that my niece Gina just told me.

266
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,603
Oh, Jack.

267
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:22,579
She said the Shelby
family are all witches

268
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:24,739
and sorcerers who speak freely
with the dead.

269
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:27,540
So who here's a Shelby?

270
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,259
Is it true?

271
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,643
- Gina.
- Hello, Ada.

272
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,619
Michael sends his regards.

273
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:41,379
You're the sister.

274
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:44,339
Yes, it seems I am indeed the sister.

275
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:45,896
I did some research.

276
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,099
You were a Communist once,
but diamonds and lipstick now.

277
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,619
Actually, I'm a Socialist.

278
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:54,459
She is Mr Shelby's political adviser.

279
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:57,539
And you, you're the future
Prime Minister of Great Britain

280
00:20:57,563 --> 00:20:59,579
- and its dominions.
- Indeed I am.

281
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:02,179
And you, Lady Diana Mitford,

282
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:05,219
the talk of London with
her amphetamines and emeralds.

283
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,259
It is her sharp mind that
I am in love with.

284
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:13,139
Men bore me. Ada, do you have a man?

285
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:16,500
My husband died,
but of course we speak often.

286
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:23,699
Between this sparkling conversation,
could I get a drink of some kind?

287
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:26,258
So this little kid Gina, she runs out,

288
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:28,060
she marries a gangster,

289
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:30,259
and now here we all are.

290
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:32,499
Oh, Jack, please, you are so blunt.

291
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:34,259
Yes, it's wonderful.

292
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:36,739
A man who is not careful with his words.

293
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,299
I'm not careful.

294
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:42,059
Just say it first then clear up
the broken glass with my bare hands.

295
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,620
There you are.

296
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:46,109
I don't seem to have a drink either.

297
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:50,339
Well, I have Scotch or Irish.

298
00:21:50,363 --> 00:21:51,779
Thomas drinks Irish.

299
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:54,099
- Where the hell is he?
- Irish.

300
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,139
He's been unavoidably detained.

301
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:59,019
- Nothing is unavoidable.
- His daughter is unwell.

302
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:00,643
He doesn't have a wife?

303
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,950
You know, I did some research
on you too, Mr Nelson.

304
00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:11,059
Ada here is the smart one of the family.

305
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,379
I learnt that when you were young
you lost a brother

306
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:15,123
and a sister to consumption?

307
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,299
No ice?

308
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,339
Well, that same awful illness
has entered our family.

309
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:32,179
And, you see, Thomas has very little
faith in current medical practice

310
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:35,139
- regarding tuberculosis.
- Man, he has that right.

311
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:37,339
He's gone off in search
of alternative approaches

312
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:38,779
to curing the disease.

313
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:41,739
Experimental work that he hopes
will save the life of his daughter.

314
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:44,180
In his shoes I would do the same thing.

315
00:22:44,723 --> 00:22:46,699
Your brother intrigues me.

316
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:49,523
Yes, he often has that effect on people.

317
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:55,546
Yes, and my future husband has that
effect on 20 million people

318
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,780
in this country who attend his rallies
and listen to his broadcasts.

319
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:04,459
It's amazing what English
upper class women can do

320
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,900
with just skin, bone and arrogance.

321
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:11,699
My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

322
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,379
and would like to invite all of you
to his home for a meeting.

323
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:18,259
A meeting where the real business
will be done.

324
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:21,132
And where you can meet like minds
from Ireland

325
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:23,859
who would also like to discuss
the future of Europe.

326
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,499
But as you say, this lunch is
purely social.

327
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,779
And looking at my glass, I see
I still don't have Champagne.

328
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:34,299
Michael told me the sister
had gone straight.

329
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:38,980
Yes, but her brother is the sun,
and the rest just orbit around him.

330
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:45,140
Gina tells me lots of things,
but I want to hear it from you, Ada.

331
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:51,969
What exactly does
the Shelby Company Limited do?

332
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:12,443
Fuck!

333
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,950
You used to have eyes in
the back of your head.

334
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:39,819
How can you change so much
and not change at all?

335
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:43,179
I have other lines of inquiry,
give me the spark plug. Gimme the...

336
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,139
Gimme the fucking spark plug.

337
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:47,403
Give you the spark, give you hope?
Is that what you want?

338
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,469
_

339
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,819
Something you should see.

340
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,500
Someone dead, someone grieving.

341
00:25:02,682 --> 00:25:04,762
A lot of hate against you.

342
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,575
You were wise to come to me, Thomas.

343
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,949
Open up the bonnet, would you?

344
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:17,540
What hate?

345
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:20,283
What hate, what grieving?

346
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:46,539
I can't explain where it is
you have to go.

347
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:47,980
So I'll take you there.

348
00:25:49,203 --> 00:25:51,459
I hope the suspension is good.

349
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,100
We're going to a wild old place.

350
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:11,379
Mrs Thorne, Mr Shelby isn't here.

351
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,419
I know. I am.

352
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,339
Do you know where he's gone?

353
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:18,619
He's gone up a mountain
looking for a miracle.

354
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,819
No-one is allowed to go in
if he's not here.

355
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:23,379
Just bring me the keys.

356
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:24,963
All of the keys.

357
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,579
Do you want tea, Mrs Thorne?

358
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,059
Whisky.

359
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:53,819
Mr Shelby doesn't allow whisky
in the building any more.

360
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,220
Then have someone go and fetch some.

361
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,259
Until Mr Shelby comes down off
his mountain, I'm in charge.

362
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:04,629
Yes, Mrs Thorne.

363
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,563
Fuck.

364
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,379
Mickey, I've got to go.
The boss's sister is here.

365
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:10,299
For the next five days, I'm not
the boss's sister, I'm the boss.

366
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,299
- Where is Arthur?
- We locked him in the cash safe.

367
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,019
When he gets the yamps really bad
he tells us to lock him in the safe,

368
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,659
to stop him from slipping down
to China Town.

369
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,939
What are the yamps?

370
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,219
When you lose your head.
When you can't control yourself.

371
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,196
Young people say it.

372
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:33,899
And Arthur gets the yamps a lot?

373
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:37,603
A lot is twice a day.
Arthur gets them three times a day.

374
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:40,939
It smells in here.

375
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:44,619
Arthur sleeps on the floor.
We lock him in at night.

376
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:46,443
On your feet.

377
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:51,796
Sit down.

378
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:57,883
Nice perfume.

379
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,299
Tommy likes you, Isiah.

380
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,619
I believe I'm suited to this life.

381
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,890
I'm not so sure about you.

382
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,099
I was given to understand that you
are no longer part of the company.

383
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,099
Hm.

384
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,179
You speak well.

385
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:22,619
I was going to be an accountant

386
00:29:22,643 --> 00:29:25,539
but everybody said I would be wasted
counting money,

387
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:27,476
instead of stealing it.

388
00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:31,819
What's the name of that perfume?

389
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:34,579
I've got a girlfriend with a birthday.

390
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,819
I want you to go to Liverpool.

391
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,219
Then I will go to Liverpool.

392
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,579
We have opium in storage at
the Salthouse docks.

393
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:45,579
Word got out among the dock workers.

394
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:48,819
They started stealing cupfuls,
now it's by the bucket.

395
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:52,780
By the bucket? The audacity of it.

396
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,619
The sale of the stolen opium
is being organised

397
00:29:57,643 --> 00:30:01,379
by a union convenor called Haydn Stagg.

398
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:04,059
In the envelope you'll find details
of where to find him

399
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,116
and what to do to him when you do.

400
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,660
Is there a black star in the envelope?

401
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,169
I decided not.

402
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,163
You decided?

403
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,530
The name of the perfume is
know your fucking place, soldier.

404
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:26,339
I decided he'll just take a beating.

405
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:30,100
And also, that you're
going to take Arthur with you.

406
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,059
Arthur, ten days clean,

407
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,819
and we're going to take him into
a warehouse full of fucking opium?

408
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:37,979
It can be your job to look after him.

409
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,699
Why take him at all?

410
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,259
It's his reputation you're taking.

411
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:45,659
The beating can be conducted
in a civilised way.

412
00:30:45,683 --> 00:30:48,180
No-one would dare fuck with
Arthur Shelby.

413
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:51,139
But they would fuck with me?

414
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,779
Yes. He is Arthur Shelby.

415
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:56,860
You're Isiah... who?

416
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:05,236
I'm just Isiah,
who is keen to learn, Ada.

417
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:08,009
Keep him clean.

418
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:12,339
Deal with Haydn Stagg,
bring Arthur back in one piece.

419
00:31:12,363 --> 00:31:16,219
And in return, I won't tell Tommy
that you're laying private bets

420
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:18,523
on races that we've fixed.

421
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,819
Just trying to make a few extra pennies,

422
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,739
buy that birthday present
for my girlfriend.

423
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:28,980
Mm, lucky girl.

424
00:32:15,443 --> 00:32:18,059
Lock the door, Lizzie.
There are people around here

425
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,763
who start drinking
this early in the morning.

426
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:28,216
No.

427
00:32:29,723 --> 00:32:33,179
I need to stay myself and be strong.

428
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:36,419
Now, come on, not with me.
You can let it go with me.

429
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:40,060
I can't cry, Ada.
If I start, I'll fall apart.

430
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:42,783
I need to stay strong for Ruby.

431
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,539
Tommy says it's just in one lung.

432
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:51,339
No. They now think it's in both.

433
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:53,860
It's moving quickly.

434
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:58,620
They collapsed the left lung
but it made no difference.

435
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:01,723
They're starting her
on the gold salts tomorrow.

436
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,539
You know somebody who died
on the gold treatment, yes?

437
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,819
Half the people I tell
look like you just did

438
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:13,323
because they know someome
who died on the gold treatment.

439
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:18,422
The person I knew was old.

440
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,390
Old and young, the same.

441
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:27,249
Have you given up, Lizzie?

442
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,419
No.

443
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,300
I'm being strong.

444
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,283
At her bedside, on my own.

445
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:41,683
While Tommy is up in the mountains
to be among the gypsies.

446
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:47,659
In truth it's a blessing
he's not around at the hospital,

447
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,139
because all he wants to do
is fight people

448
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:52,019
and blame himself,

449
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:53,859
and I've never felt so ashamed of him,

450
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:57,420
Christ, because right now
I need a normal man.

451
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,779
And it's me sitting there,
taking away the bloody rags

452
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:04,523
and watching her disappear.

453
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:29,260
Do you know when he's back, Ada?

454
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,283
He gave me instructions,
not information.

455
00:34:37,123 --> 00:34:38,940
Can you get a message to him?

456
00:34:40,029 --> 00:34:41,429
He'll be out of reach.

457
00:34:42,723 --> 00:34:45,260
Ada, I thought you might know things.

458
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,243
I've been away from all this.

459
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:51,179
You're still Gypsy.

460
00:34:51,203 --> 00:34:54,460
Yeah, well. The mystery leaves you.

461
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,421
What mystery?

462
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,860
Lizzie, is there anything
practical that I can do?

463
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,916
Before he left, he was looking
for a number for Esme.

464
00:35:08,243 --> 00:35:11,099
What's Esme got to do with this?

465
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:12,780
I thought you might know.

466
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:15,862
Esme's a Lee.

467
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:18,419
What does that mean?

468
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:21,860
The Lees and the Barwells,
they're wild tribes.

469
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:25,019
Where do they live?

470
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:27,619
They're gypsies,
they live where they like.

471
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:30,123
Fuck. Fuck, Ada.

472
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:36,523
Tribes in the mountains.

473
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:41,539
It's 1934, and the doctors
know what it is,

474
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:43,259
they know what causes it,

475
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:45,739
but oh, no, my husband, he knows better.

476
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:48,699
Not a normal man, your brother.

477
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:51,419
He's up in the mountains
with fucking horse thieves

478
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,700
and sorcerers while I'm here on my own.

479
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:58,029
Not a normal man.

480
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:49,902
It's OK, Arthur. I'll look after you.

481
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:52,433
Yeah.

482
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,339
And Ada said it would be OK
if I recruited my cousins.

483
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,020
Off the streets of Alum Rock,
and looking for the big time.

484
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,629
What do you say, Arthur?

485
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:22,603
I say big-time boys
don't ask for permission.

486
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:26,739
I think he means you're in.

487
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:28,549
Let's go.

488
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,362
Can you still ride bareback?

489
00:38:56,095 --> 00:38:58,111
We're a long way from anywhere, Esme.

490
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,939
If I find out
you've been wasting my time,

491
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,523
I'll use that rope to fucking hang you.

492
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:23,739
Right, hold up, Hold on, hold on.

493
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:26,619
Listen, you know what
you've got to do, right?

494
00:39:26,643 --> 00:39:29,539
You've got your orders,
I'm depending on you.

495
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:31,099
Do you hear me?

496
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:32,859
Let me tell you something.

497
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:38,489
Any man, any fucking man
who looked like this before...

498
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:42,358
...they're Peaky Blinder.

499
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:45,203
Peaky Blinder still looks like this.

500
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,730
After.

501
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,699
♪ I've got a real big mirror of a smile

502
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:19,700
We are here to meet
a gentleman called Haydn Stagg.

503
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,616
A gentleman?

504
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,929
Mr Stagg?

505
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:30,423
That scoundrel.

506
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:33,483
Never there when you need him.

507
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:38,659
Who needs him?

508
00:40:38,943 --> 00:40:40,303
We do.

509
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:42,843
Where is he?

510
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:49,819
Last I saw he was up to his balls
in a lady called Maria.

511
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:55,619
We have no time for tradition

512
00:40:55,643 --> 00:40:57,945
or the rules of the sporting life.

513
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:00,299
Because, among the Peaky Blinders,

514
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:04,899
any man who comes home from
a mission with all his bullets,

515
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:07,022
he pays a fine.

516
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,419
My name's Haydn Stagg.

517
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:13,403
I hear there's some men here
from Birmingham looking for me.

518
00:41:14,736 --> 00:41:17,856
I was in the banana warehouse
playing football with the boys.

519
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:29,456
But I'm guessing you gentlemen
aren't here to kick footballs.

520
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:32,459
No.

521
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:35,729
We're here about other business.

522
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,031
We like to call it Black Star business.

523
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:40,682
The Black Star a pub, is it?

524
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:45,849
Yeah. The Black Star's a pub.

525
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:49,819
The last pub you ever fucking drink in.

526
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,459
The Peaky Blinders
take you to the Black Star

527
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:54,502
and all your troubles are done.

528
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,260
But the pub you drink in, Mr Stagg,

529
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,099
is called The Dolphin, right?

530
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,260
Every night you're in there.

531
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:10,099
Not to drink,

532
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:13,363
you're there divvying up
the days takings, in't ya?

533
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:17,843
And there's a woman there.

534
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:23,940
She sings out, "Opium for sale!"

535
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:28,402
Sit down, boys.

536
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:36,669
The rules say the King puts his head
on the block and the game is up.

537
00:42:38,835 --> 00:42:41,515
You're stealing from
the Shelby Company Limited.

538
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,343
You're stealing from
the Peaky Blinders, man.

539
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:50,909
Therefore...

540
00:42:53,422 --> 00:42:54,902
...punishment...

541
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:59,289
...is a visit to the Black Star pub.

542
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:11,378
But, out of kindness of my heart,

543
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,620
your sentence has been commuted.

544
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,739
Praise the fucking Lord!

545
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,396
And our lovely Ada, eh?

546
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,260
Instead...

547
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:31,569
...instead, Mr Haydn Stagg,
it's just a beating for you.

548
00:43:34,303 --> 00:43:35,863
Well, before I take this beating...

549
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:40,060
Arthur Shelby, is it, yeah?

550
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:46,419
Well, comrade, beneath your sleeves
lies the truth.

551
00:43:46,443 --> 00:43:48,779
The marks on your arm.

552
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:50,395
Yeah.

553
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,139
Stories about you come up the canal.

554
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:57,739
Where once you walked fine alone,
now you need a stick.

555
00:43:58,116 --> 00:44:00,076
Let's just fucking do it, Arthur.

556
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:04,859
For me it was the morphine
they gave us in France.

557
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,260
I got a taste for it, Arthur.

558
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,283
It was 1924 before I realised
the fucking war was over.

559
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:17,619
There's a warehouse full of it is
just across the yard, there,

560
00:44:17,643 --> 00:44:20,019
where the boys play football.

561
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:22,779
And they steal it
and roll around laughing,

562
00:44:22,803 --> 00:44:24,643
and it floats in the air.

563
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:29,419
But I'm strong, comrade.

564
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:32,589
Arthur. Let's just fucking do it.

565
00:44:34,763 --> 00:44:37,499
- Liar.
- It's me that's due a beating.

566
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:41,019
But it's me who feels sorry
for you, Mr Shelby.

567
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:45,619
Because you take your beating
every hour of every day.

568
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:49,780
Your own blood betrays you,
because it demands dilution.

569
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,979
And sometimes you want to cut
a doorway in your arm

570
00:44:54,003 --> 00:44:57,179
so your blood can escape
and leave you in blessed peace.

571
00:44:57,203 --> 00:44:58,540
Yeah.

572
00:44:59,736 --> 00:45:01,256
Fuck you, man.

573
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:04,700
I was once where you are now, Arthur.

574
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:10,465
If you're going to do it, do it.

575
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:13,420
But look at me as the man you can be.

576
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:18,540
You've tried Jesus, yeah?

577
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,260
Yeah, he looked you up and down
and he shook his head.

578
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:23,435
Your loved ones...

579
00:45:24,963 --> 00:45:27,420
...your wife, your kids.

580
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:36,100
Jesus and your wife
and your kids can't help you.

581
00:45:37,883 --> 00:45:41,500
Only you, Arthur Shelby.

582
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,403
Only you.

583
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:46,419
Don't count the days.

584
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:47,980
Futile.

585
00:45:48,243 --> 00:45:51,220
You get to 100, then you wake up
and it's fucking one again.

586
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:56,780
Don't build mountains.

587
00:45:58,229 --> 00:46:00,300
Walk like it's a flat plain.

588
00:46:01,203 --> 00:46:05,203
Easy step by easy step.

589
00:46:07,043 --> 00:46:10,340
Arthur, just give me the fucking
word and I'll fucking do it.

590
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:17,580
Use your stick, Arthur.
Give him the order.

591
00:46:22,803 --> 00:46:25,819
Arthur, I'm not going to ask you
fucking twice.

592
00:46:25,843 --> 00:46:27,739
Isiah, leave him alone.

593
00:46:27,763 --> 00:46:29,243
No... No fucking way.

594
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,340
I said you can stand down.

595
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:50,843
Let's go, come on.

596
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:54,860
Come on, all of ya. Go on. Go on.

597
00:47:31,563 --> 00:47:33,179
Gypsy graveyard?

598
00:47:33,203 --> 00:47:34,860
You can still read the signs.

599
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:38,683
No horse will go beyond here.
We'll have to walk.

600
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,899
Just tell me whose grave it is.

601
00:47:48,923 --> 00:47:50,739
You'll see.

602
00:47:50,763 --> 00:47:52,883
Who knows what you'll see?

603
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:57,139
Do you ever go to John's grave?

604
00:47:57,163 --> 00:47:58,859
Things are really bad.

605
00:47:58,883 --> 00:48:00,540
When what's really bad?

606
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,100
I've done bad things, Esme.

607
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:06,739
And you think now you're being
punished for them?

608
00:48:06,763 --> 00:48:08,579
I would like to make amends.

609
00:48:08,603 --> 00:48:11,459
You want to lift every curse
anyone has ever put on you?

610
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:13,339
That's a lot of lifting.

611
00:48:13,363 --> 00:48:15,099
My own curse is in there somewhere.

612
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:16,739
I should have done more to protect John.

613
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:17,939
You think in this holy place

614
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:19,899
the spirits are listening to you
being kind?

615
00:48:19,923 --> 00:48:23,499
Believe it or not, Esme,
I am discovering kindness.

616
00:48:23,523 --> 00:48:25,323
I'm learning it from my children.

617
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,939
Do you ever think
you've lost your mind, Thomas?

618
00:48:28,963 --> 00:48:30,339
Lost it long ago.

619
00:48:30,363 --> 00:48:32,779
I only use the crate it came in.

620
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:34,779
I know why you're here.

621
00:48:34,803 --> 00:48:36,259
I'm in a hurry, Esme.

622
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:38,739
You think you can make a deal
even with death?

623
00:48:38,763 --> 00:48:41,179
Well, soon you'll be in
the right place to do it.

624
00:48:41,203 --> 00:48:44,059
The village disappeared.
The church fell down.

625
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,900
Only us still use the graveyard.

626
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:49,340
Do you recall a sapphire?

627
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:54,139
You gave a sapphire to
a woman called Bethany Barwell.

628
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:55,659
Ten years ago.

629
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,779
She took the stone back to her camp.

630
00:48:57,803 --> 00:49:00,699
I warned her about it,
but she took it anyway.

631
00:49:00,723 --> 00:49:03,139
She gave the sapphire to her sister.

632
00:49:03,163 --> 00:49:04,939
Evadne Barwell.

633
00:49:04,963 --> 00:49:07,779
Evadne put the stone around
the neck of her daughter.

634
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:09,140
A little girl.

635
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:13,540
Straight away, the little girl
began to cough.

636
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:17,539
She died that night.

637
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:18,883
Seven years old.

638
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:28,409
I heard they threw the sapphire
in the river.

639
00:49:29,563 --> 00:49:31,420
No-one's ever gone to look for it.

640
00:49:33,876 --> 00:49:36,636
I'm guessing it'll be the girl's
mother who laid the curse.

641
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,375
Only women can lay curses.

642
00:49:41,203 --> 00:49:44,179
Perhaps she waited until
your little girl was seven,

643
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:46,222
so you'd know how it feels.

644
00:49:57,322 --> 00:49:59,380
- Do you have whisky?
- No.

645
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:16,980
Tommy.

646
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:21,020
Perhaps the treatment will work
and your daughter will live.

647
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:24,540
It's science.

648
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:27,979
Science is winning everything
these days.

649
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,070
Even against the angels.

650
00:50:34,723 --> 00:50:36,860
I can leave you, if you want.

651
00:50:37,523 --> 00:50:39,660
Your horse will know his way back.

652
00:50:40,323 --> 00:50:43,499
But I think there should be some
reward for what I have shown you.

653
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:47,700
Some consideration.
You can afford it, Mr Shelby OBE.

654
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:50,739
I will find her.

655
00:50:50,763 --> 00:50:53,059
I will find this fucking Evadne Barwell,

656
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,419
I will fucking find her,

657
00:50:54,443 --> 00:50:56,579
and I will give her money
to take back this curse.

658
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:58,819
You only found me
because I wanted to be found.

659
00:50:58,843 --> 00:51:00,939
And the Barwells roam from
the border to the sea.

660
00:51:00,963 --> 00:51:03,059
I will give her £10,000. More. Anything.

661
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,459
You will put out word, Esme.

662
00:51:04,483 --> 00:51:07,179
You will put out word. I will
put out word, and I will find her.

663
00:51:07,203 --> 00:51:09,158
And instead of this poor wooden cross...

664
00:51:09,182 --> 00:51:11,458
- Tommy!
- ...I will build a monument

665
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:12,859
to this little girl.

666
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:14,259
Her mother can decide how big.

667
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:16,939
It can be as big as fucking
Nelson's Column.

668
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:19,299
That and £10,000.

669
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:22,619
I will buy her off.
I will start looking today.

670
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:24,140
Ruby will be well.

671
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:27,139
She will be well!

672
00:51:27,163 --> 00:51:30,299
And I will undo the many wrongs
that I have done.

673
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:32,819
Now that I'm without whisky
I can hear the spirits clearly,

674
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:35,299
and they're saying Ruby
will be well, if I make amends.

675
00:51:35,323 --> 00:51:36,659
That is the conversation.

676
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:39,579
If you want my help, I will help
you, Thomas, if you also pay me.

677
00:51:39,603 --> 00:51:41,979
Pay me and I will help you to find her.

678
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:44,099
- I will pay you.
- But I don't want money.

679
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:46,699
I don't read the papers,
but I know there was a crash,

680
00:51:46,723 --> 00:51:49,099
and nothing is certain
and money loses value.

681
00:51:49,123 --> 00:51:51,819
Instead of money, give me gold.

682
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:54,029
Gold. Yes, I will give you gold.

683
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:56,779
In uncertain times,
gold is always certain.

684
00:51:56,803 --> 00:51:58,539
I will give you gold.

685
00:51:58,563 --> 00:52:00,739
And you will help me find this woman.

686
00:52:00,763 --> 00:52:03,379
And she will spare my daughter.

687
00:52:22,323 --> 00:52:24,580
- Lizzie!
- Where the fuck were you?

688
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,259
Where were you?

689
00:52:27,396 --> 00:52:29,036
Where the fuck were you?

690
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:35,963
She's gone, Tommy.

691
00:52:39,883 --> 00:52:40,963
She's gone.

692
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,660
Just now. At 5.17.

693
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:53,820
You weren't fucking here, were you?

694
00:52:54,856 --> 00:52:55,976
Were you?

695
00:53:07,523 --> 00:53:10,739
It was before then, and she
was here, and then she was gone,

696
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:12,923
and now she's gone to where
they've put the dead.

697
00:53:15,923 --> 00:53:17,883
They've put her with the dead people.

698
00:53:28,603 --> 00:53:30,940
She was asking, just now, for you.

699
00:53:32,182 --> 00:53:33,222
But went...

700
00:53:35,316 --> 00:53:36,356
...at 5.17.

701
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,090
I told her that you loved...

702
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:52,969
I gave her your kiss goodbye.
