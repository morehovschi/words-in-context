﻿1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,280
In New York City, at 6am,

2
00:00:02,305 --> 00:00:05,775
the Wall Street Stock Exchange crashed.

3
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:08,352
I told Michael on
Friday this was going to happen.

4
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:11,300
We were most definitely on board.

5
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:15,703
But you have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

6
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:23,660
- My name is Mosley.
- Oswald Mosley.

7
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:25,300
Yeah, I know who you are.

8
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:27,221
You have come to my attention.

9
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,860
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the London Times.

10
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,860
Ten years ago, I was a journalist
on the Birmingham Evening Mail.

11
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,780
Course, working in that city,

12
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:38,900
it was impossible not to know your name.

13
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,660
And your... reputation.

14
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:44,820
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,300
Is it evolution or revolution?

16
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,170
_

17
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:22,221
Dad! There's a phone call for you!

18
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:30,541
Dad! There's a phone call for you!

19
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:33,061
Charlie!

20
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,980
Charlie! Wait!

21
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:39,867
Charlie!

22
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,407
Giddy-up, horsey, giddy-up!

23
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,670
- Dad, there's a phone call for you.
- Good boy.

24
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,020
Good boy.

25
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,100
Will you go back to the house?

26
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,300
And, er, whoever's calling,

27
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,940
the operator will have their number,

28
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,429
and I'll call them back, eh?

29
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:22,660
Oh, look, Charlie.

30
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,460
You must have violin practice.

31
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:25,980
It's Mrs Milligan.

32
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:27,021
Go on.

33
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:29,580
And, Charlie!

34
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:32,100
Charlie, you play loudly.

35
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,207
You might hear some bangs.

36
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:36,707
Go on.

37
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,340
Mr Shelby?

38
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:32,863
Maggie, yeah, it's me.

39
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:35,183
- Yes, Mr Shelby.
- I just missed a call.

40
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:36,583
Where was it from?

41
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,303
Belfast.

42
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:41,743
Belfast. Where in Belfast?

43
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,863
Um, I'm not sure.

44
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:45,703
Do you have the number?

45
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:47,144
Yeah.

46
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:51,223
Yeah, can you put me through?

47
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:00,860
Tommy, don't believe...

48
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,916
Mr Shelby.

49
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,556
My name is Captain Swing,

50
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:11,743
calling from the occupied Six Counties.

51
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:14,343
And there are some people
from the other side

52
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:17,783
of our neat little city
that want you dead.

53
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:23,743
You should also know that this boy,
this Michael, your kin,

54
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:27,229
was in his cabin aboard the SS
Monroe in Belfast dock,

55
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,183
making deals with the very men
who want you dead.

56
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:31,223
Tommy, they're lying!

57
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:34,744
Now, if you want, we can put
a bullet in his head here and now...

58
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,224
...or we can send him home,
and you can deal with him.

59
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:45,784
Send him home.

60
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:48,823
Very well, Mr Shelby.

61
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:53,143
But be informed that this kin of
yours was talking to representatives

62
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:56,423
from the County Tyrone and Glasgow UVF

63
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:58,743
about how they'd divide up
the English racetracks

64
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:02,064
- after they'd blown away your legs.
- Tommy, they're lying!

65
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:05,820
And may I ask...

66
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,704
...why you are doing me this favour?

67
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:12,930
Because, Mr Shelby,

68
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:16,143
we've been informed
by people at the very highest level

69
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:19,103
that, since your conversion to socialism,

70
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:21,663
you are now on the side of the angels.

71
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,824
And angels can be useful to us.

72
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,104
Come.

73
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:02,623
Mr Shelby, the violin teacher
wants to know

74
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,024
what all those bangs were.

75
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,543
Fireworks.

76
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:08,224
Was trying them out for Saturday.

77
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:14,264
You promised the doctor
not until after dark.

78
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:17,384
Oh, it's pretty dark, Frances.

79
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:25,239
Also, will Mrs Shelby and Ruby
be home for dinner tonight?

80
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,904
I don't know.

81
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:37,344
Dad?

82
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:40,703
I've learned something this morning.

83
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:42,297
Have you?

84
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:46,264
So have I.

85
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:48,944
And what have you learned, my boy?

86
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:11,382

87
00:12:11,824 --> 00:12:15,063
Let's get this over with.
I've got a train to catch.

88
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:16,303
Go get your train, Tom.

89
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:18,183
- I can deal with this.
- Oi.

90
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:20,904
Get it!

91
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,024
Go home.

92
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:46,063
Come here, you.

93
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,303
Put this on.

94
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:50,943
There you go.
Look at that, it looks great on you.

95
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,664
Wrap up warm.

96
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:05,340
Ah!

97
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:07,064
Wake up.

98
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,423
Rise and shine.

99
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:11,843
What are you doing here?

100
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,584
Wasting our fucking time on you.

101
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,663
Sit down, Finn.

102
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,244
Sit down.

103
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:29,931
What do I have to do...

104
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,463
...to make you fucking listen to me?

105
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,255
You took a bullet.

106
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:39,664
You've been running around the streets
with a fucking gun in your hand.

107
00:13:41,224 --> 00:13:42,744
Somebody has to.

108
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,823
Finn, we've got people
for that kind of work.

109
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:51,583
Soldiers. Captains and corporals.

110
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,904
Well, then, what am I?

111
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:55,583
"What am I?" Jesus Christ.

112
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,060
Yeah, what am I, Tom, huh?

113
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,663
I'm the brother you never got round to.

114
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:04,263
You're a general, Finn.

115
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:05,543
You understand?

116
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,863
You're a fucking Shelby,
so you're a general.

117
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:12,904
When did you last see a general anywhere
near the blood and the puke, eh?

118
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:16,140
He's fucking right.

119
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,296
That's what you are.

120
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:20,140
So on your feet, soldier.

121
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,589
Come on, on your feet.

122
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,780
I thought you just said I was a general.

123
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:27,143
I did just say you were.

124
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:28,623
So get on your fucking feet!

125
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:30,423
Arthur...

126
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:32,823
Finn. Finn.

127
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:34,063
Look at this.

128
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:38,183
This is the bullet
that Aberama Gold cut from you.

129
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,664
First and last.

130
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,544
First and last.

131
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:50,864
Don't lose it.

132
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:54,943
Go and clean up, put some clothes on.

133
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,703
A nice suit.

134
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:59,144
I've got some trouble
that'll keep you out of trouble.

135
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:03,343
- Oh, and, erm, Tom...
- Yeah?

136
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:04,863
...while you're here,

137
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:06,999
erm, I've met this girl

138
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,463
- and I'd like to get married.
- Fuck off. Go, get dressed.

139
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:11,943
Go on, move. Go!

140
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,103
Finn, this girl you're trying to impress,

141
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:15,544
tell me about her.

142
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:18,063
She likes the life.

143
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:20,020
She likes the life, eh?

144
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:21,743
Well, find one that hates it.

145
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:24,824
Look at him, that's what he did.
Now he's chairman of the board.

146
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:28,864
Go on. Hurry up.

147
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,103
Arthur?

148
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:34,704
Lizzie and Ruby, are they still at yours?

149
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:39,703
Yes, Tom, they're still there.

150
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:42,343
She's coming home today, she said, so...

151
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:43,784
...she'll be home later.

152
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:47,623
Hm. Has she been talking about me?

153
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:50,583
I mean, they talk a lot,
you know what women are like.

154
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,583
The kitchen and, you know,
kids running around.

155
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,703
I... I don't pay 'em no mind, Tom.

156
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,624
- I don't listen to 'em 'alf the time.
- Yeah.

157
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,304
Well, everything she says is true.

158
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:05,744
Well...

159
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:09,383
...you like the life, Tommy.

160
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,463
I don't like the fucking life.

161
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:13,303
I don't like the fucking life,

162
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:15,624
I don't like that Michael
is coming back today.

163
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:21,383
Train arrives from Liverpool at three.

164
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:22,783
Polly will be there.

165
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:23,944
Take a weapon.

166
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:27,343
Tell Moss to clear the station
of coppers.

167
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:28,480
You hear me?

168
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:29,784
Yes, sir.

169
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:33,944
Hey, Tommy.

170
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:37,624
I heard 'em say one thing, though.

171
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,620
Just talking, you know,
they were saying that, er,

172
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:45,380
you... you don't sleep or something.

173
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:47,344
You can't sleep.

174
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,780
When I do sleep, I dream.

175
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:57,743
And in my dream, someone wants my crown.

176
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,144
I think it might be Michael.

177
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:02,877
Call me at three.

178
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:12,303
Arthur, I'm going to put
that bullet on a necklace

179
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:14,463
and wear it as a reminder.

180
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,143
Arthur?

181
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:18,623
- I heard you.
- You got trouble for me, then?

182
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:20,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

183
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:37,903
Mr Shelby, the... the police are here
to see you.

184
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,423
Police aren't allowed in here.

185
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:42,464
Er, he's not in uniform
and said it's very unofficial.

186
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,155
Afternoon. Someone get you some tea?

187
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,730
No, I'm fine, Mr Shelby.

188
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:53,344
- This won't take long.
- Good.

189
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:56,383
You've got five minutes.

190
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,943
Mr Shelby, there was a shooting
two days ago.

191
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,783
A man died.

192
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:04,451
It was a murder.

193
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:07,357
In Maida Vale.

194
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:09,857
Of all places.

195
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,637
- His name was Levitt.
- Uh-huh.

196
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,704
He was a journalist.

197
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:32,623
The night before he was shot,
he came here to see you.

198
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,103
We found a Commons pass
and your name in his diary.

199
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,020
I was wondering
what his business here was.

200
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,024
And I'm wondering...

201
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:47,144
...what your business here is.

202
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:51,622
According to his diary,
you knew him from Birmingham.

203
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:53,144
What's your name?

204
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,341
Stacker.

205
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,384
Stacker. OK.

206
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:02,580
Mr Shelby, Mr Levitt was a queer.

207
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:05,183
Some may think
it was one of his queer friends...

208
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:06,863
Mr Stacker,

209
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:10,543
I get the feeling that,
with a little provocation,

210
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:12,503
you could be very persistent.

211
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,823
Only within my remit.

212
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:17,223
Well, your Chief Constable Wyatt,

213
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,303
he has clear views about persistence,

214
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:20,823
which he has shared with me.

215
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:21,983
Mr Shelby...

216
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:25,743
He likes persistence, as do I.
And thoroughness.

217
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:27,024
But not frivolity.

218
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:34,823
A man who walks in the park with
other men dies in Maida Vale.

219
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,540
And you come to me?

220
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:39,983
As well as his diary,
we have his notebook.

221
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,420
Your time's up, Mr Stacker.

222
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:55,744
Thank you.

223
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:37,140
Hello, Mum.

224
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,104
This is Gina.

225
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,844
Gina Gray.

226
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:47,264
The captain married us on board.

227
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:51,983
She's my wife, Mum. At least look at her.

228
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,744
Tommy said to ask you
to tell me the truth.

229
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,823
We've been travelling for 15 days,
Mrs Gray.

230
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,023
Maybe we could talk about this
at another time.

231
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:03,463
Yes. Let's go home and we can talk.

232
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:07,943
You have no home
until you tell me the truth.

233
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:09,503
Here?

234
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:10,980
Yeah.

235
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,464
Michael!

236
00:21:18,224 --> 00:21:19,624
Hello, love.

237
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:23,980
Welcome to Birmingham, eh?

238
00:21:25,504 --> 00:21:26,860
Michael?

239
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:30,024
OK.

240
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,463
Our ship docked at Belfast.

241
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,495
I was then taken off the ship by two men.

242
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,383
- At gunpoint.
- I'm speaking to my son.

243
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:40,584
Fuck you.

244
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:43,863
Fuck you too, Arthur.

245
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:48,464
This is my fucking wife.
I bring her home, to this?

246
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:52,860
Come on, Gina.

247
00:21:56,744 --> 00:21:59,423
Well, where are you going now, eh? Hmm?

248
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,263
Introduce me at least.

249
00:22:01,264 --> 00:22:03,583
- Excuse me.
- Look at this.

250
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:05,432
Look at this.

251
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,060
This is it, Gina.

252
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:10,700
This is my fucking people.

253
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,223
Do you want to know the truth, Arthur?

254
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:14,624
Do you want to know the truth, Mum?

255
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:21,224
I did not betray my fucking family!

256
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,584
Now, Mum...

257
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,064
...I want to go home.

258
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,900
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

259
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:35,100
Was that Tommy's orders, then, was it?

260
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:38,904
See, the Midland Hotel
is Tommy's little kingdom.

261
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:42,900
Where all the porters keep an eye,

262
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:46,983
where all the telephone exchange
girls are reporting on my calls.

263
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:50,703
Yeah, well, why don't you think
of it like,

264
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,940
er, quarantine, Michael, eh?

265
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:56,904
We'll treat you like a fucking dog, hmm?

266
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,143
Smelly one.

267
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,464
Stinking one.

268
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:07,263
Until we know you're clean, hmm?

269
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,343
Fuck you, Arthur.

270
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,263
Stand aside, Arthur.

271
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,864
No, Poll.

272
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:21,863
Come on, baby.

273
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:23,703
Forget about 'em.

274
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:26,903
Go and phone Tommy, tell him.

275
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:29,743
Polly says Michael's telling the truth.

276
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:32,383
It's all right. Forget about 'em.

277
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:34,064
All right, Poll.

278
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,143
Nice coat.

279
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:39,984
What are you like? Camel, right?

280
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,130
Oh.

281
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:49,540
Welcome to the family, Gina Gray.

282
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:56,823
I applaud the attempt
by Mr Rowley in the Education Bill

283
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:59,743
to raise the school leaving age to 15.

284
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,543
I also support...

285
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:19,783
...as regards means-testing of any kind,

286
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,503
- we are the people...
- Yeah!

287
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,583
- ...we've had enough.
- Yeah!

288
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:27,703
"We are the people,
and we've had enough."

289
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:29,464
I move in favour of the amendment.

290
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,424
Mr Shelby.

291
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:51,504
I must say, you sing like a songbird
in the House.

292
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:55,383
And who is this pretty finch?

293
00:24:55,384 --> 00:24:56,423
My sister.

294
00:24:56,424 --> 00:24:57,583
Who's pregnant.

295
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:58,863
And dangerous.

296
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,543
Oh, we adore dangerous.

297
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:03,063
Who's we?

298
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:05,209
It's a collective noun,

299
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,956
in this case describing a group of
people who are impatient and young

300
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:12,264
and, as I have said, adore dangerous.

301
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:17,304
Mr Shelby, you had a horse of that name.

302
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:20,743
Whiskey. Irish.

303
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,091
Give him one from my bottle.

304
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:26,260
And one for myself.
In fact, bring the bottle.

305
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:27,983
And the lady?

306
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,623
Isn't thirsty.

307
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:31,304
How do you know about the horse?

308
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:35,260
We have a mutual acquaintance.

309
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:37,503
May Carleton.

310
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:41,344
When I asked about you, she said,
"Oh, my goodness, where do I begin?"

311
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:45,223
And why were you asking after me?

312
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:47,783
Because, as I have said,

313
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:49,664
I adore dangerous.

314
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:52,503
And where did she begin?

315
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,543
You know, I was rather hoping
we might have this meeting alone.

316
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:58,103
My sister is my political adviser.

317
00:25:58,104 --> 00:26:01,583
And my advice just now was,
"Don't meet Mr Mosley."

318
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:03,503
Because I am dangerous?

319
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:04,820
No.

320
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:08,263
What is it you are impatient for,
Mr Mosley?

321
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,024
I'm impatient for my fucking whiskey.

322
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:15,824
Bennett!

323
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,183
May Carleton spoke about you

324
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:24,063
the way I imagine one might
about a party they barely remember,

325
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:26,983
where you crash the car into the dovecote

326
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:30,463
and live on champagne and cocaine
for three whole days.

327
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,103
You know, that kind of party.

328
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:34,184
Only three days?

329
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:36,624
Hmm.

330
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:43,903
My sister advised against meeting you

331
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:48,384
because it appears you are moving
away from the party...

332
00:26:49,864 --> 00:26:52,063
...in a different direction.

333
00:26:52,064 --> 00:26:54,060
And which direction is that?

334
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:56,623
Towards fascism.

335
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,824
"We are the people,
and we have had enough."

336
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,704
I thought that was excellent.

337
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:08,540
In which direction are you heading,
Mr Shelby?

338
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,023
I am my own revolution.

339
00:27:12,324 --> 00:27:15,044
And you prefer Irish to Scotch.

340
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:17,983
As do I.

341
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:21,983
Like all things regarding Ireland,
it is... complex.

342
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,064
Yes?

343
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:31,984
Oh!

344
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:35,936
Where do you stand
on the Irish question, Mr Shelby?

345
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,903
Never been asked it.

346
00:27:38,904 --> 00:27:41,223
Then perhaps it's time you were.

347
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,143
Tommy, I am the people,
and I have had enough.

348
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:48,823
We are looking for someone
to begin a dialogue...

349
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:51,223
...with certain elements in Belfast

350
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:54,183
with whom we don't officially
have any dealings.

351
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,743
I'll be too busy singing in the House.

352
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,980
It would involve a promotion.

353
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:04,580
Junior Minister to the Duchy
of Lancaster.

354
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,823
Birmingham is my concern.

355
00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:12,580
Ireland bores me.
Thanks for the whiskey, Mr Mosley.

356
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,060
Hmm.

357
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,903
What the fuck was that about?

358
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:27,063
Ireland. It's been Ireland's day
all fucking day long.

359
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:28,103
What do you mean?

360
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:31,823
Ada, go home and start calling
anyone who had dealings

361
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:34,423
with Shelby Company Limited
while you were in Boston.

362
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:35,624
Ask them about Michael.

363
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:39,463
Ask them what about him?

364
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:41,863
Who he's been seeing,
who he's been meeting,

365
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:44,663
- what deals he's made.
- Why?

366
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:49,343
Ask 'em especially about people
he's met from Glasgow or Belfast.

367
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:52,823
Tommy, why don't you come back
with me, eh?

368
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:54,823
You can play chess with Karl.

369
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:56,783
I'll make some calls, you can listen in.

370
00:28:56,784 --> 00:28:57,863
Drive home tomorrow.

371
00:28:57,864 --> 00:29:00,583
That bastard starts talking
about Irish whiskey.

372
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:01,943
The fuck does he know? Eh?

373
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:04,903
More than me, Tommy.
What are you talking about?

374
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:08,183
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

375
00:29:08,184 --> 00:29:10,503
My chair. My throne.

376
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:12,183
People thinking I'm going to fall,

377
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,703
they start behaving
in a different way around you.

378
00:29:14,704 --> 00:29:16,183
Who thinks that?

379
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,463
They start to circle.

380
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,583
Who's going to take the throne, eh?

381
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:23,023
Linda, she wants some for Arthur,

382
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:25,584
Aberama Gold, people in the north,
Michael...

383
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:32,860
Just go home, make some calls.

384
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:35,463
Protestants are coming, I think.

385
00:29:35,464 --> 00:29:37,504
I need to get back to Birmingham.

386
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:52,103
Polly.

387
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:54,097
Are you armed?

388
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:56,260
Yeah.

389
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,303
Yeah.

390
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:00,918
Would you please consider
putting your weapons behind the bar

391
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,120
in case feelings begin to run high?

392
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:04,745
Behind the bar, Poll, eh?

393
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:07,904
Behind my own bar, yeah?

394
00:30:14,744 --> 00:30:16,060
I prefer it there.

395
00:30:18,464 --> 00:30:20,224
Thomas?

396
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:30,303
I had a dream...

397
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:33,784
...about a black cat last night, Poll.

398
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:39,183
A black cat dream
means there is a traitor close by.

399
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:40,943
It was you who taught me that.

400
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:43,463
Black cat can mean lots of things.

401
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,023
Can mean you're hurting yourself.

402
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:47,184
Betraying yourself.

403
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,864
Are you seeing things, Thomas?

404
00:30:53,224 --> 00:30:54,463
Yes, I am.

405
00:30:56,184 --> 00:30:58,624
Yes, I am. Very clearly.

406
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:02,380
Coming from every fucking direction.

407
00:31:16,384 --> 00:31:17,504
Tommy.

408
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,864
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.

409
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:25,503
I would also like to, er, say something.

410
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:28,143
- Sit down, Michael.
- I betrayed you.

411
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:30,380
- Michael.
- But only in my heart.

412
00:31:30,904 --> 00:31:32,703
There was a time,

413
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:34,263
in America,

414
00:31:34,264 --> 00:31:36,703
and there was a lot of money
in that bank.

415
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,943
And I wondered
if I could... I could leave,

416
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:40,460
move to California.

417
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,180
Someone said I should invest in pictures.

418
00:31:44,264 --> 00:31:45,424
Hollywood.

419
00:31:46,984 --> 00:31:48,464
But Gina stopped me.

420
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:52,384
- Gina said...
- I told you to sit down, Michael.

421
00:32:01,104 --> 00:32:02,184
Now, tell me...

422
00:32:03,904 --> 00:32:05,580
...what happened on that ship

423
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:08,297
in Belfast harbour.

424
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:13,460
On the journey back from New York,
we got married.

425
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,063
But we needed to find a witness.

426
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,383
A purser.

427
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,903
He was from Belfast.

428
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,103
We got friendly.

429
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,824
What happened when the ship docked?

430
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:28,383
This purser had friends who ran a
whiskey distillery in County Tyrone.

431
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:30,863
They wanted a way
of getting their stuff into America.

432
00:32:30,864 --> 00:32:33,180
So I said, "OK, invite them aboard."

433
00:32:33,624 --> 00:32:37,023
When they came in, I realised
that they didn't make whiskey.

434
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:38,983
They were Scottish. From Glasgow.

435
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:41,663
Couldn't understand
a fucking word they were saying.

436
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,303
They started swearing,

437
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:45,944
so I asked Gina to leave.

438
00:32:46,984 --> 00:32:49,460
That was when they started talking
about you, Tom.

439
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:53,060
They said that Tommy Shelby
was a spent force,

440
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,940
that politics had got to him...

441
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,263
...that he was spent in the head,

442
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,943
that now was a good time to move in

443
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:03,460
and did I want to be part of it.

444
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,703
They knew about the money we lost
in America.

445
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:08,383
They said that you were going
to blame me.

446
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:10,784
That you had a bullet with my name on it.

447
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,823
What did you say, Michael?

448
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:16,580
I didn't have time to say anything.

449
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:19,303
Coppers came on board.

450
00:33:19,304 --> 00:33:21,904
Well, I thought they were coppers.
They, er...

451
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:24,783
They were IRA.

452
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:26,224
Exactly.

453
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:34,580
And the first men from Glasgow?

454
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:41,744
The IRA commander said the men
from Glasgow were called Billy Boys.

455
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:44,183
Fucking Billy Boys.

456
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:46,463
I don't know who the fuck Billy Boys are.

457
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:49,463
They run every man in every coalmine,

458
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:52,303
on every shipyard east of Glasgow.

459
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,383
Ties with Belfast, UVF.

460
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,343
Protestant razor gang.

461
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:00,700
They also dabble in politics.

462
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:05,420
You know, muscle for fascist rallies.

463
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,100
But you did no deal, Michael?

464
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,180
You didn't even know who they were?

465
00:34:10,564 --> 00:34:13,324
I was too busy looking forward
to giving you the good news.

466
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:17,021
The reason Gina and I
got married on the ship

467
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:18,888
was because Gina is pregnant.

468
00:34:20,304 --> 00:34:22,224
You're going to be a grandmother.

469
00:34:30,564 --> 00:34:31,884
OK, Michael.

470
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,983
I believe you.

471
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,470
Welcome home.

472
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:38,704
Congratulations.

473
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,220
Just remember...

474
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,503
...your unborn child has witnessed
what you said.

475
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:49,063
- Thomas!
- And it will be born according to...

476
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:50,183
You fuck!

477
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:53,663
Where the fuck are you going, hmm?

478
00:34:53,664 --> 00:34:55,624
Are you fucking mad, hmm?

479
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:03,183
- You are free to fucking leave, Michael.
- You fucking bastard.

480
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,900
But you're not free, Michael, are you?

481
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:09,343
You lost this company a lot of money.

482
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:10,860
I told you to sell...

483
00:35:12,504 --> 00:35:13,943
...but you held on,

484
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:18,783
and now I want you to pay me back
what you owe me.

485
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:22,380
There is work you can do,
there are risks you can take.

486
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,889
We were close before.

487
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,100
Now I want you closer still.

488
00:35:29,264 --> 00:35:31,540
Michael, honey.

489
00:35:32,984 --> 00:35:34,384
Look at your cousin.

490
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,020
He's in trouble, huh?

491
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,850
He needs you.

492
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:44,580
Come on, baby, let's go.

493
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:11,060
Fucking cheek of her, eh?

494
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,340
Mad Dog Jimmy.

495
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:16,580
Coming south.

496
00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:23,303
Not so mad any more.

497
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:25,500
He's got friends in high places
these days.

498
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,784

Who the fuck are you?

Did you not hear my song?

509
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,624
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

And me?

511
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:16,463
I'm Jimmy.

Ah, fuck, fuck.

513
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,583
Good.

514
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:23,183
Mouth broke, so you can't talk.

515
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,783
But you don't need to.

516
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:28,544
Your body will be the lesson.

517
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:34,760
You work in a particular capacity
for Mr Thomas Shelby, OBE.

518
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:36,140
Am I right?

519
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:44,384
I heard you're a fighter.

520
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:47,224
The best.

521
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,663
But your fighting days are over.

522
00:38:54,144 --> 00:38:57,863
Because I need Mr Shelby to understand...

523
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,620
...that his best...

524
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,703
...is not... good enough.

525
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:58,103
Bonnie!

526
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:01,064
Farewell, fighter boy. You died well.

527
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:13,663
Bonnie...

528
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:15,304
Bonnie!

529
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:32,584
Tell Tommy Shelby
it's time to fucking share.

530
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:37,823
We'll take all the tracks out
as far as Nottingham.

531
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:39,704
We'll take Cheltenham as well.

532
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:45,343
Otherwise, it will be Thomas Shelby
who's crucified,

533
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:48,064
and there will be no resurrection.

534
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,304

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going
to take a short break. Thank you.

539
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:44,144
Yeah. Good man.

540
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:55,744
Beautiful, Billy, beautiful.
Really nice. Really nice.

541
00:41:59,924 --> 00:42:03,363
Really meaningful, you know?
A heartfelt song.

542
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05,940
I like it. I really do.

543
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,700
Boys, this here is Billy Grade.

544
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,500
Man I was telling you about, son.

545
00:42:15,037 --> 00:42:17,081
Billy, this here's my kid brother, Finn.

546
00:42:17,106 --> 00:42:18,127
Hey.

547
00:42:19,024 --> 00:42:21,380
Have a drink, Billy.

548
00:42:22,024 --> 00:42:23,423
I can't, my voice is...

549
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:25,863
Drink, Bill.

550
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,144
Yeah.

551
00:42:28,224 --> 00:42:29,424
Yeah.

552
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:36,571
You boys won't remember...

553
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:41,188
...but I remember when Billy here
made a living on the football pitch.

554
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:45,143
Oh, yeah, that was a long time ago,
Mr Shelby.

555
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:46,784
- Yeah, what a left foot, eh?
- Yeah.

556
00:42:48,224 --> 00:42:53,223
And then what? Manager, right? Hmm?

557
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,655
Well, yeah, and now I'm a singer.

558
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,220
Are you?

559
00:42:58,144 --> 00:43:03,183
Every football team in England
knows Billy Grade.

560
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:07,063
And he knows a few people, too.
Don't you, Bill, eh? Hmm?

561
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:09,344
- One or two.
- Useful.

562
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,943
Very useful.

563
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,063
But what do you do, Bill, eh?

564
00:43:15,064 --> 00:43:16,580
Hmm?

565
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:21,543
You're in here, singing,
or whatever the fuck you call it,

566
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:24,903
in shit-hole pubs in Birmingham.

567
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:30,064
It's no way to make a living, boys.

568
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:33,423
- Degrading.
- I love it.

569
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,624
I really do, I love it.

570
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:39,703
And thank you, by the way,
for inviting me here tonight.

571
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:41,469
I really appreciate it,
so thank you very much.

572
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,303
Don't thank me.

573
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:45,420
I didn't invite you here to sing.

574
00:43:47,344 --> 00:43:51,863
If I wanted to listen to music,
I'd buy an Al Jolson record. Hmm?

575
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:53,580
That's what I'd do.

576
00:43:54,144 --> 00:43:56,583
Real singer, you know?

577
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,183
Melody.

578
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,020
Tune.

579
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,710
So what is it that you want... exactly?

580
00:44:08,464 --> 00:44:12,344
Finn will explain
the nature of my proposition.

581
00:44:13,697 --> 00:44:15,896
You'll listen to him,
won't you, Bill, eh?

582
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:18,760
- You'll be attentive, won't you?
- Yeah, of course, course.

583
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:19,984
Because Isiah here,

584
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:23,304
he'll show you the fucking
consequences if you don't.

585
00:44:25,744 --> 00:44:27,024
All right?

586
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:32,384
I'll leave you with the bottle, hmm?

587
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,543
What proposition?

588
00:44:49,482 --> 00:44:51,583
Right, what I want from you, Billy,

589
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:56,033
is for you to write down
a name and a number

590
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:59,026
next to every one of those football
teams, yeah?

591
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:00,983
- Why?
- Why?

592
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:03,223
People like to bet on those kind of
things these days.

593
00:45:03,224 --> 00:45:05,303
- We are a gambling enterprise.
- I know who you are.

594
00:45:05,304 --> 00:45:09,183
To fix a horse race, you give
the outsider a bit of cocaine.

595
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,063
Jesus! To fix a football match,

596
00:45:11,064 --> 00:45:13,140
you give the goalkeeper £20.

597
00:45:24,824 --> 00:45:27,823
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Billy.

598
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:29,024
Hmm?

599
00:45:37,144 --> 00:45:39,184
What have you got there?

600
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,143
I've written a letter.

601
00:45:42,144 --> 00:45:43,584
Oh.

602
00:45:46,664 --> 00:45:48,143
Who for?

603
00:45:48,144 --> 00:45:49,620
For you.

604
00:45:50,024 --> 00:45:52,104
And Lizzie's written one to Tommy.

605
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:56,377
Well...

606
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,038
...can I read it?

607
00:45:59,063 --> 00:46:00,503
It's not finished yet.

608
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,524
I'm getting rid of the parts
I wrote when I was drunk.

609
00:46:05,177 --> 00:46:07,216
By the way, I've stopped drinking.

610
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:10,224
And your bottles of snow
I poured down the lavatory.

611
00:46:11,704 --> 00:46:13,583
When I was drunk, I was too hard on you.

612
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:15,144
It's... It's not your fault.

613
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:21,704
So...

614
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,703
That letter's about me, is it?

615
00:46:25,704 --> 00:46:26,824
Yeah.

616
00:46:28,064 --> 00:46:29,904
- Hmm.
- And about me.

617
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:33,064
About the future. About the company.

618
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:36,263
Lizzie and I...

619
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:39,503
Sat here and made things worse
the last few hours, hmm?

620
00:46:39,504 --> 00:46:41,623
Yeah, and we've come up with a plan.

621
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:43,783
Oh, you've come up with a plan, eh?

622
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:45,623
Lizzie says Tommy won't live
two more years

623
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:47,543
if he carries on like this.
He's gone too far.

624
00:46:47,544 --> 00:46:49,223
Is that what Lizzie says, hmm?

625
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:50,503
Really now?

626
00:46:50,504 --> 00:46:53,263
Well, how far has he gone, hmm,
Linda? How far?

627
00:46:53,264 --> 00:46:55,332
He's lost all the legitimate money
in America.

628
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:57,727
No. No, that was Michael.

629
00:46:57,728 --> 00:47:00,658
He's fixing races. He's fixing football.

630
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:03,709
Following the financial crisis,
the Shelby Company Limited

631
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:07,303
has to find other sources of cash income.

632
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:09,103
Tommy went into Chinatown.

633
00:47:09,104 --> 00:47:12,260
He's selling out the Communists
to the British intelligence.

634
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,354
And all the time, every day,
he gets more and more famous.

635
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:16,729
But that's OK.

636
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,183
Because if anyone puts
two and two together...

637
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:20,503
That wasn't us.

638
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:22,559
It's not fucking us!

639
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,063
It's going to blow up, Arthur!
It can't sustain.

640
00:47:25,064 --> 00:47:27,543
- You know it.
- Oh, yeah? And what do you know, eh?

641
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,223
You've worked it all out.

642
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,383
You and fucking Lizzie, eh?

643
00:47:31,384 --> 00:47:34,420
Got it all planned out, is that right?

644
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,303
And I tell you,

645
00:47:37,304 --> 00:47:41,383
all you're going to do is you're
going to be the good fucking wife.

646
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,183
Yeah, like the perfect couple.

647
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:46,303
We'll go upstairs, hmm?

648
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:48,380
We'll go upstairs.

649
00:47:49,024 --> 00:47:51,740
Yeah, make love, hmm?

650
00:48:02,184 --> 00:48:05,704
I spent my day writing two letters
and deciding which one to give.

651
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:09,624
Looks like I'll have to give
the other one.

652
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,570
What other one?

653
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,524
What fucking other one?!

654
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,184
What did you do with my letter?

655
00:48:33,424 --> 00:48:34,624
I burnt it.

656
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:37,864
So did Arthur.

657
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:42,544
- Did you read it first?
- Yes.

658
00:48:43,704 --> 00:48:45,024
That's more than Arthur did.

659
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:52,904
Didn't help that you can't fucking spell.

660
00:48:54,504 --> 00:48:56,144
I left school too early.

661
00:48:57,304 --> 00:48:59,463
Did you read the bit about the lawyers?

662
00:48:59,464 --> 00:49:00,864
Do you want to fuck?

663
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,224
Didn't think so.

664
00:49:05,824 --> 00:49:07,700
- You don't want to eat?
- No.

665
00:49:08,664 --> 00:49:10,134
- You've got calls?
- Yeah.

666
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:20,864
It's Ruby's birthday today, Tommy.

667
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:26,580
Do you know why I took her to Arthur's?

668
00:49:27,224 --> 00:49:29,260
Because she said she's scared of you.

669
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:33,544
When she knows you're not coming
home, she's a different kid.

670
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:37,263
But I've bought a cake.

671
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:38,740
And I want you there.

672
00:49:39,664 --> 00:49:40,944
We're in the drawing room.

673
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,390
Lizzie...

674
00:49:51,984 --> 00:49:53,344
I'm in a room...

675
00:49:54,704 --> 00:49:56,784
...and they're coming at me.

676
00:49:58,904 --> 00:50:00,860
It's OK. I want 'em to.

677
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:04,420
Last thing I want is silence.

678
00:50:06,424 --> 00:50:08,183
Standing up there, in silence,

679
00:50:08,184 --> 00:50:09,544
and someone says...

680
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,943
..."Sorry about all that noise.

681
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:18,620
"Sorry about all that... dust.

682
00:50:19,424 --> 00:50:21,623
"Sorry about all that mud.

683
00:50:21,624 --> 00:50:23,704
"And all that fucking blood."

684
00:50:25,224 --> 00:50:27,180
And you say, "Don't be sorry.

685
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:29,897
"Don't be sorry. It's all I can do now."

686
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:36,884
You want me to write this down?

687
00:50:39,024 --> 00:50:41,024
Do you want me
to write you a fucking letter?

688
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,650
Me and Arthur can't write it down...

689
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,904
...cos they haven't invented
the fucking words.

690
00:50:53,264 --> 00:50:55,584
We don't have the fucking words.

691
00:50:58,903 --> 00:51:00,420
And the worst thing is...

692
00:51:02,384 --> 00:51:03,944
...could've stayed at school.

693
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:07,060
But we volunteered.

694
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:11,504
Still don't have the fucking words.

695
00:51:20,784 --> 00:51:22,783
Should you choose to depart, Tommy,

696
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:25,183
either by your own hand
or someone else's,

697
00:51:25,184 --> 00:51:27,784
the person who would take
your place is me.

698
00:51:29,024 --> 00:51:30,303
Legally.

699
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:32,063
Financially.

700
00:51:32,064 --> 00:51:33,184
Everything.

701
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:36,224
I need to know
there'll be something left.

702
00:51:37,384 --> 00:51:40,584
Well, you know, Lizzie, in my head,
I still pay you for it, so...

703
00:51:41,824 --> 00:51:43,464
...good luck with me.

704
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:52,704
I have business.

705
00:52:17,704 --> 00:52:21,143
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

706
00:52:21,144 --> 00:52:25,263
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

707
00:52:25,264 --> 00:52:27,264
Yeah, I want to ask you some questions...

708
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:30,624
...about the night you met Michael Gray.

709
00:52:37,984 --> 00:52:39,623
Make a wish.

710
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:41,264
Yeah!

711
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:08,543
OK, kids, come on, let's go to bed.
Quickly.

712
00:53:08,544 --> 00:53:10,063
Why? Who's coming?

713
00:53:10,064 --> 00:53:13,500
That's the thing, Charles,
we don't know. We never know.

714
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,744
Tommy!

715
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:40,623
- Get out of the fucking car.
- Don't!

716
00:53:40,624 --> 00:53:44,408
Get out of the fucking car now,
or I'll open fire!

717
00:53:52,984 --> 00:53:55,143
If you're looking for traitors,

718
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:59,463
there's one... with his ribs mashed up.

719
00:53:59,464 --> 00:54:02,100
The man's gone fucking mad, Tom!

720
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,863
You did this?

721
00:54:04,864 --> 00:54:06,864
With one arm and a hammer.

722
00:54:07,904 --> 00:54:12,020
And a mighty pain... and a mighty fury!

723
00:54:14,664 --> 00:54:16,104
They killed him.

724
00:54:18,264 --> 00:54:19,424
My son!

725
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:24,023
They shot him and they put him
up on a fucking cross,

726
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:25,744
and he's fucking dead!

727
00:54:26,744 --> 00:54:28,104
Who did?

728
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,503
Only Johnny Dogs and his kin
knew where we were camped.

729
00:54:44,504 --> 00:54:47,183
No, Tom. No.
I swear to God, I never told a soul.

730
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:49,823
- Get the fuck away!
- I never told a fucking soul.

731
00:54:49,824 --> 00:54:52,703
How could you fucking do this?!
My fucking son!

732
00:54:55,704 --> 00:54:57,343
They fucking took him from me!

733
00:54:57,344 --> 00:55:00,863
My only... son!

734
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,143
Johnny!

735
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:03,823
Tommy!

736
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:05,703
Your shoulder is shattered.

737
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:08,143
If you don't get it fixed,
you'll lose your arm.

738
00:55:08,144 --> 00:55:10,703
He's gone! Fucking killed him!

739
00:55:10,704 --> 00:55:13,743
Fucking son! My own fucking kin!

740
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,223
Listen to me!

741
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,820
How can a one-armed man
avenge the death of his son, eh?

742
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,504
They crucified my son...

743
00:55:29,704 --> 00:55:30,904
...for you.

744
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:43,703
Get away from my house! All of you!

745
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,820
Get away from my child!

746
00:55:47,504 --> 00:55:49,943
This is my house.

747
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,223
And I don't want you back.

748
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,344
I don't want you back!

749
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:14,423
If you want to take on the Billy Boys,

750
00:56:14,448 --> 00:56:15,568
you need me alive.

751
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:20,363
Everyone fucking needs me.

752
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,614
Call an ambulance,

753
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,864
or a man will lose his arm.

754
00:56:47,644 --> 00:56:49,323
Come on, Johnny.

755
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,664
Come on.

756
00:56:54,224 --> 00:56:55,344
Tom...

757
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,823
I'm no black cat, Tom.

758
00:56:59,824 --> 00:57:01,704
I know, Johnny. I know.

759
00:57:03,304 --> 00:57:06,183
In all the world, of all of the people,

760
00:57:06,184 --> 00:57:08,144
you alone I know I can trust.

761
00:57:09,945 --> 00:57:11,945
